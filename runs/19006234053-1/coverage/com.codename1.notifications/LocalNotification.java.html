/**
 * &lt;p&gt;Local notifications are user notifications that are scheduled by the app itself. They
 * are very similar to push notifications, except that they originate locally, rather than
 * remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * They enable an app that isnt running in the foreground to let its users know it
 * has information for them. The information could be a message, an impending calendar
 * event, or new data on a remote server. They can display an alert message or
 * they can badge the app icon. They can also play a sound when the alert or badge
 * number is shown.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * When users are notified that the app has a message, event, or other data for them,
 * they can launch the app and see the details. They can also choose to ignore the notification,
 * in which case the app is not activated.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;This class encapsulates a single notification (though the notification can
 * be repeating).
 *
 * &lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
 * &lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/shannah/a5592313da97e085822120af16518874.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The default image that is used on the android top status bar
 * and on the notification itself is the App's icon.  However Android 5 and above will only display
 * this image as a silhouette using alpha pixels.  This will result in many icons appearing to be
 * a blank white square.  In such cases you can provide an alternate image to be displayed instead.
 * Place a 24x24 image named &quot;ic_stat_notify.png&quot; in your project's {@literal native/android}
 * directory, and this image will be used instead.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
