/**
 * Parent class for all plugin events.  Plugin events are fired by the Codename One runtime
 * to give plugins an opportunity to override the implementation of certain core methods.
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;For example, the {@link OpenGalleryEvent} is fired when the {@link Display#openGallery()} method
 * is called.  This event will be passed to registered plugins, which  can choose to &quot;consume&quot; the event
 * and override the behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;If a plugin wishes to handle the event, it should call {@link #consume()} on the event to prevent
 * Codename One from proceeding to handle the request itself.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * &lt;p&gt;Events that require a synchronous return value should call the {@link #setPluginEventResponse(Object)} method
 * with the return value.  {@link #setPluginEventResponse(Object)} calls {@link #consume()}, so you do not need
 * to call both of these methods.&lt;/p&gt;
 *
 * @param &lt;T&gt; The type of the response to the event. If the event does not require a response, this should be {@link Void}.
