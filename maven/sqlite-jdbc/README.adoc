= sqlite-jdbc Shaded Jar

This is a shaded jar that includes the sqlite-jdbc jar with the slf4j-api jar shaded into it at a different package,
so as not to conflict with other libraries that might include slf4j.

We needed to add this when we upgraded to version 3.46.1.0 of the sqlite-jdbc library, because it adds a dependency on slf4j-api.
