/**
 * <p>{@code Externalizable} is similar to the Java SE {@code Externalizable} interface this interface. 
 * Notice that due to the lack of reflection and use of obfuscation these objects must be registered with the
 * Util class.<br>
 * Also notice that all externalizable objects must have a default public constructor.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Built-In Object types</h3>
 * <p>
 * The externalization process supports serializing these types and considers them to be {@code Externalizable}.
 * E.g. you can just write {@code Storage.getInstance().writeObject(new Object[] {"Str1", "Str2"});} and it will work
 * as expected. <br>
 * Notice that while these objects can be written, the process doesn't guarantee they will be read with the same
 * object type. E.g. if you write a {@link java.util.LinkedList} you could get back a {@link java.util.ArrayList} as both
 * implement {@link java.util.Collection}:<br>
 *  {@link java.lang.String},  {@link java.util.Collection},  {@link java.util.Map},  {@link java.util.ArrayList}, 
 *  {@link java.util.HashMap}, {@link java.util.Vector},  {@link java.util.Hashtable},  {@link java.lang.Integer},
 * {@link java.lang.Double}, {@link java.lang.Float}, {@link java.lang.Byte}, {@link java.lang.Short}, 
 * {@link java.lang.Long}, {@link java.lang.Character}, {@link java.lang.Boolean}, {@code Object[]},
 * {@code byte[]}, {@code int[]}, {@code float[]}, {@code long[]}, {@code double[]}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The sample below demonstrates the usage and registration of the {@code Externalizable} interface:
