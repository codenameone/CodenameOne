/**
 * <p>A connection request that can detect a GZipped response, parse it automatically and unzip it.
 * Notice that some devices (iOS) always request gzip'ed data and always decompress it for us, however in
 * the case of iOS it doesn't remove the gziped header. The {@code GZConnectionRequest} is aware of such
 * behaviors so it's better to use that when connecting to the network (if applicable).</p>
 * <p>
 * By default `GZConnectionRequest` doesn't request gzipped data (only unzips it when its received) but it's
 * pretty easy to do so just add the HTTP header `Accept-Encoding: gzip` e.g.:
