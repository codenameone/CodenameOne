            The Localization API allows developers to adapt their applications to different geographic locales and
            conventions. 
        </p>
        <h3>Portable Localization</h3>
        <p>
            Most of the classes within this package are clones of Java SE classes such as {@link com.codename1.l10n.SimpleDateFormat}
            vs. {@link java.text.SimpleDateFormat}. The main motivation of placing these classes here and using the
            cloned version is portability. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If we would use {@link java.text.SimpleDateFormat} its behavior would be slightly different on Android 
            or in the simulator vs. its behavior on iOS. That is because the implementation would be radically different.
            When you use {@link com.codename1.l10n.SimpleDateFormat} the implementation might be missing
            some pieces but it would be more consistent with the implementation you would get on the device which
            is always preferable.
        </p>
        <h3>L10NManager</h3>
        <p>
            The localization manager allows adapting values for display in different locales thru parsing and formatting
            capabilities (similar to JavaSE's DateFormat/NumberFormat). It also includes language/locale/currency 
            related API's similar to Locale/currency API's from JavaSE.<br>
            The sample code below just lists the various capabilities of the API:
