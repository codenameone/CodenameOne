/**
 * <p>The LocationManager is the main entry to retrieveLocation or to bind  a LocationListener, 
 * <strong>important:</strong> in order to use location on iOS you will need to define the build 
 * argument {@code ios.locationUsageDescription}.
 * This build argument should be used to describe to Apple &amp; the users why you need to use the location 
 * functionality.</p>
 * <p>
 * Trivial one time usage of location data can look like this sample:

 * <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/5c2f411e1687793409d5.js"></script>
