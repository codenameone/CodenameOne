            Abstraction of location services (GPS/Geofencing etc.) providing user global positioning and monitoring over
            such changes both in the foreground and background.

            Trivial one time usage of location data can look like this sample:

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/codenameone/5c2f411e1687793409d5.js"></script>
        
        <p>
            You can also track location in the foreground using API calls like this:
