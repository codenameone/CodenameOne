            Video and Audio playback support are handled within this package using the 
            {@link com.codename1.media.Media} &amp; {@link com.codename1.media.MediaManager} APIs.
            Said API's allow for video playback both within a native full screen player and embedded within 
            an application screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Simplified video playback API is also available via the {@link com.codename1.components.MediaPlayer} class.
            Capture/recording is handled separately for the most part thru the 
            {@link com.codename1.capture.Capture} API. However, there is some basic low level recording
            functionality within {@link com.codename1.media.MediaManager} as well. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The code below demonstrates capturing and playing back audio files using this API:
