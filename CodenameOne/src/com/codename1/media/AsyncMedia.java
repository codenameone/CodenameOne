/**
 * An interface for media elements that provides asynchronous pause and play functionality
 * as well as support for state change events, so that interested parties can register
 * to be notified when state changes between play and pause.
 * <p>
 * You can convert any {@link Media} object into an AsyncMedia object using {@link MediaManager#getAsyncMedia(com.codename1.media.Media) }.
 * In most cases this just casts the object to AsyncMedia, since most media returned from {@link MediaManager} already implement
 * this interface.  In cases where the media doesn't already implement AsyncMedia, it will return an Async wrapper around the media.
