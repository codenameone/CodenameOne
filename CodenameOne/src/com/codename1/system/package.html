            Low level calls into the Codename One system, including support for making platform native API calls. Notice
            that when we say "native" we do not mean C/C++ always but rather the platforms "native" environment. So in the
            case of J2ME the Java code will be invoked with full access to the J2ME API's, in case of iOS an Objective-C
            message would be sent and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Native interfaces are designed to only allow primitive types, Strings, arrays (single dimension only!) of primitives
            and PeerComponent values. Any other type of parameter/return type is prohibited. However, once in the native layer
            the native code can act freely and query the Java layer for additional information. <br/>
            Furthermore, native methods should avoid features such as overloading, varargs (or any Java 5+ feature for that matter)
            to allow portability for languages that do not support such features (e.g. C).<br/>
            Important! Do not rely on pass by reference/value behavior since they vary between platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Implementing a native layer effectively means:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Creating an interface that extends NativeInterface and only defines methods with the arguments/return
            values declared in the previous paragraph.</li>
            <li>Creating the proper native implementation hierarchy based on the call conventions for every platform
            within the native directory</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            E.g. to create a simple hello world interface do something like:
        </p>
        <pre>
            package com.my.code;
            public interface MyNative extends NativeInteface {
                  String helloWorld(String hi);
            }
        </pre>
        <p>
            Then to use that interface use MyNative my = (MyNative)NativeLookup.create(MyNative.class);<br/>
            Notice that for this to work you must implement the native code on all supported platforms!
        </p>
        <p>
            To implement the native code use the following convention. For Java based platforms (Android, RIM, J2ME):
        </p>
        <p>
            Just create a Java class that resides in the same package as the NativeInterface you created
            and bares the same name with Impl appended e.g.: MyNativeImpl. So for these platforms the code
            would look something like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
            package com.my.code;
            public class MyNativeImpl implements MyNative {
                  public String helloWorld(String hi) {
                       // code that can invoke Android/RIM/J2ME respectively
                  }
            }
        </pre>
        <p>
            Notice that this code will only be compiled on the server build and is not compiled on the client. 
            These sources should be placed under the appropriate folder in the native directory and are sent to the
            server for compilation.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Objective-C, one would need to define a class matching the name of the package and the class name 
            combined where the "." elements are replaced by underscores. One would need to provide both a header and
            an "m" file following this convention e.g.:
        </p>
        <pre>
@interface com_my_code_MyNative : NSObject {
}
- (id)init;
- (NSString*)helloWorld:(NSString *)param1;
@end
        </pre>
        <p>
            Notice that the parameters in Objective-C are named which has no equivalent in Java. That is why the native
            method in Objective-C MUST follow the convention of naming the parameters "param1", "param2" etc. for all 
            the native method implementations. Java arrays are converted to NSData objects to allow features such as length
            indication.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            PeerComponent return values are automatically translated to the platform native peer as an expected return
            value. E.g. for a native method such as this: PeerComponent createPeer();<br/>
            Android native implementation would need: View createPeer();<br/>
            While RIM would expect: Field createPeer()<br/>
            The iphone would need to return a pointer to a view e.g.: - (UIView*)createPeer;
            J2ME doesn't support native peers hence any method that returns a native peer would always return null.<br/>
