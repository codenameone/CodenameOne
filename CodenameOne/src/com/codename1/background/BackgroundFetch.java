/**
 * An interface that can be implemented by an app's main class to support background fetch.
 * 
 * <h4>What is Background Fetch?</h4>
 * 
 * <p>Background fetch is a mechanism whereby an application is granted permission by the operating system
 * to update its data periodically.  At times of the native platform's choosing, an app that supports background
 * fetch will be started up (in the background), and its {@link #performBackgroundFetch(long, com.codename1.util.Callback) } method will be called.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note: Since the app will be launched directly to the background, you cannot assume that the {@code start()} method has been 
 * run prior to the {@link #performBackgroundFetch(long, com.codename1.util.Callback) } method being called.</p>
 * 
 * <h4>How to Implement Background Fetch</h4>
 * 
 * <p>Apps that wish to implement background fetch must implement the {@link BackgroundFetch} interface
 * in their main class.  On iOS, you also need to include <code>fetch</code> in the list of background 
 * modes (i.e. include "fetch" in the <code>ios.background_modes</code> build hint.)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>In addition to implementing the {@link BackgroundFetch} interface, apps must explicitly set the background fetch interval
 * calling {@link com.codename1.ui.Display#setPreferredBackgroundFetchInterval(int) } at some point, usually in the <code>start()</code> or <code>init()</code> method.</p>
 * 
 * <h4>Platform Support</h4>
 * 
 * <p>Currently background fetch is supported on iOS, Android, and in the Simulator (simulated using timers when the app is paused).  You should
 * use the {@link com.codename1.ui.Display#isBackgroundFetchSupported() } method to find out if the current platform supports it.</p>
 * 
 * <h4>Examples</h4>
