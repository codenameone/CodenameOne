/// Saves what the user was doing, brings it back when the app starts again, and -- where the
/// platform or your own endpoint can carry it -- lets them pick it up on another device.
///
/// ```java
/// // in init()
/// Continuity.setStateProvider(new StateProvider() {
///     public Map<String, Object> saveState() {
///         Map<String, Object> m = new HashMap<String, Object>();
///         m.put("draft", draftField.getText());
///         return m;
///     }
///     public void restoreState(Map<String, Object> payload) {
///         pendingDraft = (String) payload.get("draft");
///     }
/// });
///
/// // in start()
/// if (!Continuity.restore()) {
///     Navigation.navigate("/home");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// #### What is saved
///
/// Two halves. The framework contributes the `com.codename1.router.Navigation` stack, so an app
/// whose screens are declared with `@Route` gets them back with no code at all. Your
/// `StateProvider` contributes everything else. An app that navigates with `new MyForm().show()`
/// has no route stack to save -- those navigations are not addressable -- and restores from the
/// payload alone.
///
/// #### When it is saved
///
/// Continuously, not at shutdown. Every navigation marks the state dirty and a checkpoint is
/// written once per event loop pass, so by the time the operating system suspends the app the work
/// is already done. This is deliberate: on Android the platform blocks its own main thread until
/// the app's `stop()` returns, and an app that did its saving there would be paying for it on
/// every single suspend. Call `checkpoint()` directly after changing something the provider
/// reports but no navigation touched.
///
/// #### Getting it back
///
/// `restore()` returns true when it showed something, so `start()` reads as "restore, or else
/// begin". It is never called for you: an app that adopts this API decides where restoration fits
/// in its own launch, and an app that does not is completely unaffected.
///
/// #### Other devices
///
/// `isContinuationSupported()` reports whether this platform can advertise the current state to
/// the user's nearby devices; on Apple platforms it can, elsewhere it cannot and the call is a
/// no-op rather than an error. For everything the platform will not carry -- iOS to Android, two
/// devices that are never together -- set a `StateRelay`, which is your own endpoint. Codename One
/// runs no server for this, because deciding which states belong to the same person is your
/// account system's job.
///
/// Arriving states are offered to every `ContinuityListener` before anything happens, and this
/// device's own echo is never offered at all.
///
/// #### Zero cost when unused
///
/// Referencing this package is what makes the build declare the activity type on Apple platforms
/// and compile the native continuation handling in. An app that never touches
/// `com.codename1.continuity` gets none of it.
