/**
 * <p>The JSFunction interface allows you to implement functions in Java that can
 * be called from Javascript. You can assign any JSFunction object to be a member
 * method of an existing JSObject via the {@link JSObject#set(String, Object) JSObject.set()} method. Then the function
 * can be called from javascript just like any other Javascript method. JSFunction
 * methods are called asynchronously from Javascript to prevent deadlocks. If you
 * require a return value to Javascript, you can do that by passing a callback
 * function which is called by the JSFunction with some parameters.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> The {@link com.codename1.javascript } package is now
 * deprecated. The preferred method of Java/Javascript interop is to use {@link BrowserComponent#execute(java.lang.String) }, {@link BrowserComponent#execute(java.lang.String, com.codename1.util.SuccessCallback) },
 * {@link BrowserComponent#executeAndWait(java.lang.String) }, etc.. as these
 * work asynchronously (except in the XXXAndWait() variants, which use
 * invokeAndBlock() to make the calls synchronously.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following example, adds a camera object to the Javascript environment
 * that has a capture() method, which can be used to capture images using the
 * device's camera:</p>
 *
 * <code><pre>
 * // Create a new Javascript object "camera"
 * final JSObject camera = (JSObject)ctx.get("{}");
 *
 * // Create a capture() method on the camera object
 * // as a JSFunction callback.
 * camera.set("capture", new JSFunction(){
 *
 * public void apply(JSObject self, final Object[] args) {
 * Display.getInstance().capturePhoto(new ActionListener(){
 *
 * public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
 *
 * String imagePath = (String)evt.getSource();
 *
 * // Get the callback function that was provided
 * // from javascript
 * JSObject callback = (JSObject)args[0];
 *
 * ctx.call(
 * callback, // The function
 * camera, // The "this" object
 * new Object[]{"file://"+imagePath} // Parameters
 * );
 * }
 *
 * });
 * }
 *
 * });
 *
 *
 * // Add the camera object to the top-level window object
 * ctx.set("window.camera", camera);
 *
 *
 * </pre></code>
 * <p>We can then capture photos directly from Javascript using a function similar to the following:</p>
 * <code><pre>
 * camera.capture(function(url){
 * if ( url == null ){
 * // No image was captured
 * return;
 * }
 *
 * // Fetch the preview &lt;img&gt; tag.
 * var image = document.getElementById('preview-image');
 * // Set the preview URL to the image that was taken.
 * image.src = url;
 * });
 * </pre></code>
