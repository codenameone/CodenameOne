/**
 * A Button that is rendered by the native platform, over top of the light-weight components.
 * The action listener is also fired on the native main thread.
 *
 * <p>Currently this is only used in the Javascript port because there are some functions
 * that can only be performed in direct response to user action.  Using a HeavyButton
 * rather than a button to invoke the action will solve this.</p>
 *
 * <p>WARNING: You can't use any concurrency (wait, sleep, etc..) in the action listener
 * or it will break Javascript.  Only use this class if you know what you're doing.</p>
