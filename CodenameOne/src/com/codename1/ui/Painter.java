/**
 * <p>{@code Painter} can be used to draw on components backgrounds.
 * The use of this interface allows reuse of a background {@code Painter} for various
 * components. <br>
 * A simple example of a background painter is shown here to draw a circle background:

 *
 * <p>
 * Painters can also be used to draw the glasspane which is layered on top of the form.
 * The example shows a glasspane running on top of a field to show a validation hint,
 * notice that for real world usage you should probably look into {@link com.codename1.ui.validation.Validator}.
 * Also notice that this example uses the shorter Java 8 lambda syntax to represent the glasspane.
