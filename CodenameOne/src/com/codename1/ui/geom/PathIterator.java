 * This interface provides a directed path over the boundary of a shape. The path can contain 1st through 3rd order Bezier curves (lines, and quadratic and cubic splines). A shape can have multiple disjoint paths via the {@link #SEG_MOVETO} directive, and can close a circular path back to the previous {@link #SEG_MOVETO} via the {@link #SEG_CLOSE} directive.
