/**
 * A factory class for creating mutable images.  This can be used to override how
 * mutable images are generated.  You can use this to implement, for example, a LRU
 * cache for images so that they can be reused to conserve memory.
 *
 * <p>There is a default static image factory that can be assigned by calling:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * ImageFactory.setImageFactory(null, new ImageFactory() {
 *      public Image createImage(int w, int h, int bgColor) {
 *          // create an image
 *          // The Default would be just to call
 *          return Image.createImage(w, h, bgColor);
 *      }
 * });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>You can also assign a factory whose scope is limited to a particular Form, Container,
 * or Component, by setting the context argument in {@code setImageFactory()}.</p>
