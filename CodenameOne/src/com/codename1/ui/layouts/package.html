    Layout managers allow a {@link com.codename1.ui.Container} to
    arrange its components by a set of rules that adapt to specific
    densities (ppi - pixels per inch). A layout manager is an arranging algorithm encapsulated
    by an abstract class implementation that places components absolutely based
    on the "hints" received.
</p>
<h2>Layout Managers that ship with Codename One</h2>

<p>
    {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts.FlowLayout} is default layout manager, simple, flexible and with a few caveats.
</p>

<p>
    {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts.BorderLayout} is ubiquitous thru Codename One code.
</p>
<img alt="Border Layout" src="https://www.codenameone.com/img/developer-guide/border-layout.png"/>

<p>
    {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts.BorderLayout} can also behave differently based on the center behavior flag
</p>

<p>
    {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout} Y axis is a the work-horse of component lists
</p>

<p>
    {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts.BoxLayout} X axis is a simpler replacement to flow layout and has grow/no grow
    variants.

<p>
    {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts.GridLayout} arranges elements in a grid where all elements have an equal size. It

<p>
    {@link com.codename1.ui.table.TableLayout} is similar in many regards to HTML tables. Notice that its
    in the <code>com.codename1.ui.table</code> package and not in this package.
</p>

<p>
    {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts.LayeredLayout} is unique in the sense that it is meant to costruct layers
    and not the UI positions. It only lays out on the Z axis.
</p>

<p>
    {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts.GridBagLayout} was added to Codename One to ease the porting of Swing/AWT
    applications.
</p>

<p>
    {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts.mig.MigLayout} is a popular 3rd party layout manager its Codename One
    port is experimental.
