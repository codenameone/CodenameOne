            Layout managers allow a {@link com.codename1.ui.Container} to 
            arrange its components by a set of rules that adapt to specific
            densities (ppi - pixels per inch). A layout manager is an arranging algorithm encapsulated
            by an abstract class implementation that places components absolutely based
            on the "hints" received.

        <h2>Layout Managers that ship with Codename One</h2>
        
        <p>
            {@link FlowLayout} is default layout manager, simple, flexible and with a few caveats.
        </p>

        <p>
            {@link BorderLayout} is ubiquitous thru Codename One code. 
        </p>

        <p>
            {@link BorderLayout} can also behave differently based on the center behavior flag

        <p>
            {@link BoxLayout} Y axis is a the work-horse of component lists

       <p>
            {@link BoxLayout} X axis is a simpler replacement to flow layout and has grow/no grow variants.
        </p>

       <p>
            {@link GridLayout} arranges elements in a grid where all elements have an equal size. It can auto adapt
            the column count.
