            Layout managers allow a {@link com.codename1.ui.Container} to 
            arrange its components by a set of rules that would be adapted for specific
            screen/font sizes. A layout manager is an arranging algorithm encapsulated
            by an interface, the interface implementation places components absolutely based
            on "hints" received.
