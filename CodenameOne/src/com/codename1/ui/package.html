            Main widget package containing the component/container "composite" similar
            both in terminology and design to Swing/AWT. Unlike Swing/AWT a full windowing
            system is not applicable in this case and forms are placed using a Display abstraction
            more in line with the MIDP API.

            Components are placed in a container with layout managers that are used to detemine
            component positioning {@link com.codename1.ui.layouts}, containers can be nested
            deeply in a similar way to Swing/AWT. All components are lightweight and drawn by
            the {@link com.codename1.ui.plaf.UIManager} which allows us to theme everything using
            styles. It also alows elaborate UI customizability by deriving {@link com.codename1.ui.plaf.LookAndFeel}
            and overriding specific methods for drawing/sizing components.
