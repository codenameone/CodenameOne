/**
 * CellConstraint is very similar to com.codename1.ui.table.TableLayout.Constraint in the sense it holds about the same data.
 * It is used to store the constraints of each cell, and allows modifying and readind them - then, when the actual table is drawn
 * They are converted to TableLayout.Constraint in HTMLTable.createCellConstraint.
 * <p>
 * This is needed because:
 * 1. Once a TableLayout.Constraint is used to draw a table it is assigned a parent and can't be reused again (See TableLayout.addLayoutComponent)
 * 2. TableLayout.Constraint does not allow reading its values, so cloning the constraint (without the parent) is impossible
