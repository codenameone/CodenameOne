/**
 * HTMLLink is a simple extension of Button that nullifies all its borders and attaches itself as an ActionListener to respond to link clicks.<br>
 * Since a link can be split on several lines, the concept of parent and child links is introduced here. A parent link is the first segment of the link
 * while the children are all the other segments. Only the parent is focusable (so multiple focuses on the same links will be avoided).
 * When the parent is focused, all the children get setFocus(true). Note that for pointer events, the children are also active.
