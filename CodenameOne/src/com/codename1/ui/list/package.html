            Lists are highly customizable and serve as the basis for {@link com.codename1.ui.ComboBox} and
            other components (such as carousels etc) they employ a similar MVC approach to
            Swing including the renderer pattern, <b>notice</b> that <a href="https://www.codenameone.com/blog/avoiding-lists.html">we strongly
            discourage usage of lists</a>...<br> {@link com.codename1.ui.list.ListCellRenderer}
            allows us to customize the appearance of a list entry, it works as a 
            "rubber stamp" by drawing the rendered component and discarding its state thus
            allowing very large lists with very little component state overhead.
        </p>
        <p>
            {@link com.codename1.ui.list.ListModel} allows us to represent the underlying
            data structure for the {@link com.codename1.ui.List}/{@link com.codename1.ui.ComboBox} 
            without requiring all the data to reside in memory or in a specific structure.
            This allows a model to represent a data source of any type, coupled with the renderer the
            data source can be returned in an internal representation state and still be rendered
            properly to the screen.
