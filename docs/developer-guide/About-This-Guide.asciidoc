== Preface

This developer guide is sourced directly from the `docs` directory of the https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/[Codename One Git repository]. The documentation is written in AsciiDoc, reviewed through pull requests, and published from the main branch to multiple targets.

To contribute updates, clone the repository, create a feature branch, and edit the AsciiDoc files in `docs/developer-guide`. Proposed changes are submitted as GitHub pull requests where they undergo automated and human review. Once merged, the content is rendered to the web manual at https://www.codenameone.com/manual/ and to the downloadable PDF at https://www.codenameone.com/files/developer-guide.pdf[https://www.codenameone.com/files/developer-guide.pdf]. Periodically, major revisions are collected for print-on-demand distribution.

While this guide focuses on tutorial and conceptual material, the complete API reference remains available in the https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/[Codename One JavaDoc]. The source code for the framework and this manual lives alongside each other in Git, so improvements to documentation and code can evolve together through the same contribution workflow.
