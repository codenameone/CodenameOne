== Rich Properties File (rpf) Format

The rich properties file (rpf) format is used to store configuration for the `generate-app-project` goal.  The format is the same as a regular properties file except that it can more easily accommodate properties whose values are "rich" and lengthy.

"Rich" properties use the following syntax.

[source,rpf]
----
[keyname] <1>
=== <2>
Key value <3>
=== <4>
----
<1> The property key appears on a new line wrapped in square brackets.
<2> A separator consisting of 3 or more equals signs on the very next line.
<3> The property value, which can be one or more lines of content.
<4> The separator with the same number of equals signs on a line of its own.

=== Example Rich Properties File

[source,rpf]
----
firstName=Bob
lastName=Smith
[bio]
====
Bob is a hard worker.
He attended Harvard and is looking for opportunities in the fast food industry.
====
age=23

# A comment that it is ignored
[xmldata]
========
<person>
    <name>Bob Smith</name>
    <age>23</age>
</person>
========

favoriteColor=Brown

----

Many of the properties of this file are just regular properties.  There are two rich properties: `bio` and `xmldata`.
