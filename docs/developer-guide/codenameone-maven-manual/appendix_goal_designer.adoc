=== Open Designer (`designer`)

Opens the legacy Codename One designer app to edit the project "theme.res" file.

NOTE: If your project is using CSS it may not have a theme.res file, thus this goal will fail in this case.

==== Usage Example

[source,bash]
----
mvn cn1:designer
----

This will open the Codename One designer.
