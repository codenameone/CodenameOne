=== Generate Native Interfaces (`generate-native-interfaces`)

Generates stub implementations for all native interfaces defined in the project.  This won't overwrite any existing implemetations that may exist.

You should run this goal explicitly after you create a native interface in your class.

See the Codename One Developer guide section on https://www.codenameone.com/developer-guide.html#_native_interfaces[native interfaces] for more information on creating native interfaces.

==== Usage Example

Suppose we have created a native interface as the Java interface `com.mycompany.myapp.MyNative`, as described in the example in https://www.codenameone.com/developer-guide.html#_native_interfaces[native interfaces].

After creating this (and possibly other) native interfaces in our project,  run the `generate-native-interfaces` Maven goal as follows:

[source, bash]
----
mvn cn1:generate-native-interfaces
----

This will generate the following files (if they don't exist yet).

javase::
`javase/src/main/java/com/mycompany/myapp/MyNativeImpl.java`
ios::
. `ios/src/main/objectivec/com_mycompany_myapp_MyNativeImpl.h`
. `ios/src/main/objectivec/com_mycompany_myapp_MyNativeImpl.m`
android::
`android/src/main/java/com/mycompany/myapp/MyNativeImpl.java`
windows (uwp)::
`win/src/main/csharp/com/mycompany/myapp/MyNativeImpl.cs`
javascript::
`javascript/src/main/javascript/com_mycompany_myapp_MyNativeImpl.js`

Open and edit these files to implement your native interface methods as desired.
