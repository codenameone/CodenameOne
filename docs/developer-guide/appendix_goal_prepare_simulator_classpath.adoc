=== Prepare Simulator Classpath (`prepare-simulator-classpath`)

Sets up some properties and environment variables required for the Codename One simulator to run propertly.

This goal is bound to the `initialize` phase of the `javase` module of the <<cn1app-archetype>>  and should not be executed directly.
