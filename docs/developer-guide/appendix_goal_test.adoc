=== Run Tests (`test`)

Runs Codename One unit tests.

This goal is bound to the `test` phase of <<cn1app-archetype>> projects, so that running it directly is not necessary.  If you build a <<cn1app-archetype, cn1app-archetype project>> using:

[source,bash]
----
mvn install
----

or

[source,bash]
----
mvn package
----

Then this goal will be executed automatically.

TIP: Prevent tests from running using the `skipTests` flag.   E.g. `mvn install -DskipTests`
