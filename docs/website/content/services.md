## Cross Platform Mobile App Development for IOS (IPHONE/IPAD), Android, Windows & More!

Building a mobile app is challenging. We can help...

### Full App Development

We can provide an app that runs on 2 or more mobile OS's with no additional cost!  
Typical app development shops price low then charge for refinements. We make our profit by keeping you as a customer in the long run. Our maintenence fees are included in the enterprise support package.

### Custom Theme/Design Integration

We will adapt a PSD or designer sketches to an application that will work properly across all devices/densities's. This allows your developers to focus on coding the application and have a pixel perfect design to plug into.

### Client Side Development

You have your backend and your server side developers, but don't have enough resources to build the client. Our developers can work together with your team and build you the client side of your App.

### Proof of Concept

We can build a prototype to prove that Codename One can answer your project requirements. This is the fastest way to jumpstart Codename One development and can be used to transition into an in-house development.
