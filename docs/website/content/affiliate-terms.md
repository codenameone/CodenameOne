• You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.

• You must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.

• Your login may only be used by one person - a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted.

• You may not use the Affiliate Program for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).

## **Links/graphics on your site, in your emails, or other communications**

Once you have signed up for the Affiliate Program, you will be assigned a unique Affiliate Code. You are permitted to place links, banners, or other graphics we provide with your Affiliate Code on your site, in your emails, or in other communications. We will provide you with guidelines, link styles, and graphical artwork to use in linking to **Codename One**. We may change the design of the artwork at any time without notice, but we won't change the dimensions of the images without proper notice.

To permit accurate tracking, reporting, and referral fee accrual, we will provide you with special link formats to be used in all links between your site and the **Codename One**. You must ensure that each of the links between your site and the **Codename One** properly utilizes such special link formats. Links to the **Codename One** placed on your site pursuant to this Agreement and which properly utilize such special link formats are referred to as "Special Links." You will earn referral fees only with respect to sales on a **Codename One** product occurring directly through Special Links; we will not be liable to you with respect to any failure by you or someone you refer to use Special Links or incorrectly type your Affiliate Code, including to the extent that such failure may result in any reduction of amounts that would otherwise be paid to you pursuant to this Agreement.

## **Referral fees/commissions and payment**

For a Product sale to be eligible to earn a referral fee, the customer must click-through a Special Link from your site, email, or other communications to **https://www.codenameone.com** and complete an order for a product during that session with the coupon code assigned to you.

We will only pay commissions on links that are automatically tracked and reported by our systems. We will not pay commissions if someone says they purchased or someone says they entered a referral code if it was not tracked by our system. We can only pay commissions on business generated through properly formatted special links and coupon codes that were automatically tracked by our systems.

We reserve the right to disqualify commissions earned through fraudulent, illegal, or overly aggressive, questionable sales or marketing methods.

Payments only begin once you've earned more than **$50** in affiliate income. If your affiliate account never crosses the **$50** threshold, your commissions will not be realized or paid. We are only responsible for paying accounts that have crossed the **$50** threshold.

As long as your current affiliate earning are over **$50**, you'll be paid each month. If you haven't earned **$50** since your last payment, we'll pay you the following month after you've crossed the threshold.

We use Paddle as our payment gateway. You’ll be paid after 90 days of an initial signup which is the Paddle refund window. The commission percentage is applied to our net revenue, see the [Paddle help page](https://paddle.com/support/how-is-affiliate-revenue-is-split-and-calculated/) for more information on how it’s calculated.
