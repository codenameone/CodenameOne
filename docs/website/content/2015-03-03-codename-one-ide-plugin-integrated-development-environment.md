# Codename One IDE Plugin (Integrated Development Environment)

1. [Home](/)
2. Developers
3. IDE Plugin

Codename One integrates seamlessly with the leading Java development environments (NetBeans & Eclipse) using the Codename One IDE plugin. The plugin simplifies & streamlines common tasks such as creating a new project, running/debugging it in the simulator and sending it to the build server.

The plugin is effectively the backbone between the Codename One Designer tool, the Codename One Build Server & Codename One API/Services.

The plugin, consists of several layers. Its visual layer merely adapts the IDE to the requirements of the Codename One platform, however its architecture is generic and based on an Apache Ant build system allowing its functionality to be leveraged even without IDE's.

Unlike similar tools the plugin is not all encompassing and developers can customize all aspects of the build process using Ant scripts and commonly available tools.
