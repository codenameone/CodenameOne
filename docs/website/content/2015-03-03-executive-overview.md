The main benefit of Codename One development is in shortened development cycles, easy maintenance costs and developer training.

## Build & Cloud Server Power

Codename One has a unique build server architecture that allows building native apps for iPhone without requiring a Mac and for Windows Phone without requiring a Windows machine. All of the setup of complex tools and installations is alleviated thanks to the build server.

The Codename One Cloud services simplify the process of development further by making some functionality such as object cloud storage completely seamless and infinitely scalable. It allows push notification to work on all devices with a considerably simpler setup than any other option out there.
