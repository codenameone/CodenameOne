#### Details

Some basic notes:

  * 90% of the performance problems we see relate to people using gradients. Don’t use gradients, use images.
  * The video doesn’t mention image locking, that is something that could be important is some complex usages. The second part of [this blog post](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/in-a-pinch.html) discusses that.
