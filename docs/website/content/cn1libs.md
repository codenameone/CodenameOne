## EXTEND CODENAME ONE WITH NATIVE & GENERIC LIBRARIES/PLUGINS

In this page we list plugins/extensions from various sourcesCodename One can be extended with native or Java code. However because of its flexibility it's somewhat difficult to leverage the existing JAR format to its full extent. That's why Codename One introduced the cn1lib format which allows 3rd parties to package extensions to Codename One that can be used anywhere. To learn more about the cn1lib format you can check out the Codename One Developer Guide.You can install any one of the extensions listed here by launching the Codename One settings and selecting to install an extension button: ![](/uploads/extensions-section.png) Notice that this list is generated from [this github repository](https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOneLibs) you can submit your own cn1lib easily to the list thru a pull request as explained there.
