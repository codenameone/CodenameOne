Dr. Sbaitso is based on a classic SoundBlaster demo, the virtual therapist holds a conversation with you offering help. In this case it uses an iChat like bubble chat UI with picture previews of the participant (from the camera). Chat history can be searched and on iOS and Android Text To Speech is used thru native interfaces.

Notice that the JavaScript HTML5 demo is not what we have on the device where applications are translated to native code!  
Since Apple doesn’t allow demos on itunes and doesn’t allow installing apps without itunes we can’t distribute the native app demos, you would need to build from source with an itunes demo account.
