The new [property cross demo](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/source/browse/trunk/Demos/PropertyCross/) shows off the usage of webservices, JSON parsing, infinite scroll, URLImage and lots of other Codename One features. It uses a UK webservice that allows listing properties for sale in the UK. 

We created a set of videos explaining how that demo works and the various features within it, check them out:
