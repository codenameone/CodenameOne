We are working on a new [demos](/demos.html) section for the website that will highlight the demos for  
Codename One more thoroughly. Thanks to the new JavaScript port we can actually show the demos live in  
action but that creates a bit of a problem since people often jump to the conclusion that Codename One  
uses web technologies which it does not. 

Currently the demos section is pretty bare mostly because the JavaScript port still has a lot of bugs and missing  
features. It is moving in leaps and bounds though and we are pretty confident that we will have all the major  
demos up in the demo section within a short while. However, if you are familiar with the existing demos checking  
out their JavaScript counterpart (and the desktop builds as well) will show you what we can accomplish with these  
ports. 

### Developer Guide Translation

A comment on our [developer guide announcement](/blog/new-developer-guide.html#comment-1993360936)  
caught us a bit by surprise. It seems a community member  
[translated the guide to Russian](http://wiki.ftp27host.ru/index.php?title=Codename1:%D0%98%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0)  
which is pretty cool!
