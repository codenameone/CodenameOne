I want the bootcamp to sell out fast. Since the number of spots is very limited this should be doable. To make this happen we are adding to the bootcamp:

  * **2 months of enterprise subscription** (worth $798)

  * **Free access to upcoming & current courses** (worth $398)

  * **Two one on one sessions with me** (you’d be shocked at how much I used to charge per hour as a consultant)

And that is on top of the 4 weeks of material and a full blown startup worth of progress made in a single bootcamp. We did on-site training that included far less than this for 5K per seat last year!

The signup page is [here](https://codenameone.teachable.com/p/full-stack-java-mobile-app-bootcamp/) and contains a lot of additional details.

P.S Even if this sells out quickly I won’t do another one of these. It’s too exhausting and I need to focus on Codename One. I want to keep this post brief but in my update later in the week I’ll elaborate a bit more on why.
