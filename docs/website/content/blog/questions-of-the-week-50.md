I’ve been back from the bootcamp this past week and while I have committed many new changes I’m still taking things relatively easy after the hard work of the bootcamp. This will be the last Q&A Friday segment in the blog. Starting next week I’ll replace this segment with “tutorial of the week” which will focus on publishing/updating a “How do I?” video tutorial on a weekly basis.

We pushed an update to the libraries this week with a few interesting new features that we haven’t documented yet, I hope to have time during the week to write more about these new features and capabilities.

On stack overflow we had a lot of interesting questions while I was gone so it’s hard for me to go over everything and narrow down the important ones. Here are a couple I found interesting:

[Kevin](http://stackoverflow.com/users/919222/ikevin8me) asked about [using WebRTC in Codename One](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43541962/implementing-webrtc-on-webview-with-codename-one). This is frequently asked so I’m guessing this would be interesting to several developers…​ [Steve](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2935174/steve-hannah) reviewed this and came to the conclusion that it’s doable with a small change.

[Guillaume](http://stackoverflow.com/users/7956099/guillaume-d%c3%a9vaud) asked about [reusing the generated certificate on iOS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43756338/codename-one-generated-ios-certificate-on-multiple-projects). The UX for this in our wizard doesn’t make this clear enough, we should probably give it an overhaul but [Scott](http://stackoverflow.com/users/7948581/scott-turner) did provide the right answer that you can (and should) reuse the same P12 file.
