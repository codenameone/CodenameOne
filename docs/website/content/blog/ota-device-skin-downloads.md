Chen has recently added support for a new OTA (Over The Air) skin download feature which allows us to give you more device skins while maintaining a relatively small distribution size, in fact we might shrink the distribution by removing some of the builtin skins into the new OTA download option. Most of the work on the Skins themselves was contributed by  
[  
Eric Coolman  
](http://gadgets.coolman.ca/)  
who did a lot of work on cutting these up and assembling them properly. 

  
The feature is remarkably simple as you can see in the video, just pick the device you are targeting and you should get a pretty good approximation of it on which you can debug your app just like with our existing device options or the device options downloaded from Eric’s site. If you would like to contribute/build skins for the OTA work feel free to open issues in our
