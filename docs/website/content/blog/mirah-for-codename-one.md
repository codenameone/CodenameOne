Steve Hannah of new iOS pipeline fame (as well as a ton of open source Codename One libraries and projects you can  
[  
see here  
](https://github.com/shannah)  
), has just announced one of his more ambitious undertaking:  
[  
Mirah support for Codename One  
](http://sjhannah.com/blog/?p=331)  
.  
[  
Mirah  
](http://www.mirah.org/)  
is effectively Ruby without the performance penalty of an overly dynamic language, its compiled to bytecode and can thus be compiled with the Codename One build servers.  
  
  
If you are a fan of Ruby you now have an easy option of writing mobile applications for all devices without going into Java and without paying a performance penalty!  
  
  
  
  
  
You can learn more about all of this in Steve’s  
[  
detailed blog post and video  
](http://sjhannah.com/blog/?p=331)

> It was always our intention to support additional languages thru Codename One. Our Java focus is mostly due to constrained resources, ideally as we grow we will see more diversity in this project.
