[Storage](/manual/files-storage-networking.html) is one of the big subjects we can delve into and never come out. Even without going into offshoots such as parsing, networking etc. it’s still a pretty huge subject. We tried to simplify a lot of these problems by splitting file system from storage in Codename One but this often caused a different type of confusion.

Because I tried to keep the video very simple I also didn’t get into too many samples or variations e.g. no externalization or other interesting discussions. I specifically avoided those as with properties this becomes far easier but I also think these might make the video harder/longer.
