So you have finished your app and tested it on the simulator. Everything looks good. You’re now ready to proceed with testing on your iPhone. You select the "Send iOS Debug Build" menu item and wait for the build server to work its magic, but then you’re faced with a notice that iOS builds require a valid certificate and provisioning profile. What a hassle!

If you’ve done any iOS development (not just Codename One) I’m sure you’ve hit this speed-bump before. You can’t **just** test your app on your iPhone. You have to jump through a series of hoops imposed by Apple before you get the privilege of testing your app on your phone. You need to create an App ID with the necessary permissions, generate a certificate signing request, download your certificates, generate mobile provisioning profiles to register your iPhone to be able to test your app. And finally, you have to export your certificates into a format that can be used in Codename One. If you have a Mac, this process is annoying at best. If you don’t, then this process might be your show-stopper.

Personally, I find the iOS certificate process to be the single most painful part of app development. That is why I’m happy to announce that the next version of the Codename One plugin will include a wizard that generates all of these things for you with just a few mouse clicks.

## How it works

To generate your certificates and profiles, simply open your project’s properties, and click on "iOS" in the left menu. This will show the "iOS Signing" panel that includes fields to select your certificates and mobile provisioning profiles.

![Netbeans iOS Signing properties panel](/blog/ios-certificate-wizard/ios-cert-wizard-1-signing.png)

If you already have valid certificates and profiles, you can just enter their locations here. If you don’t, then you can use the new wizard by clicking the "Generate" button in the lower part of the form.

### Logging into the Wizard

After clicking "Generate" you’ll be shown a login form. Log into this form using your **iTunes Connect** user ID and password. **NOT YOUR CODENAME ONE LOGIN**.

### Selecting Devices

Once you are logged in you will be shown a list of all of the devices that you currently have registered on your Apple developer account.

![Devices form](/blog/ios-certificate-wizard/ios-cert-wizard-3-devices.png)

Select the ones that you want to include in your provisioning profile and click next.

![After selecting devices](/blog/ios-certificate-wizard/ios-cert-wizard-4-devices-selected.png)

If you don’t have any devices registered yet, you can click the "Add New Device" button, which will prompt you to enter the UDID for your device.

### Decisions & Edge Cases

After you click "Next" on the device form, the wizard checks to see if you already have a valid certificate. If your project already has a valid certificate and it matches the one that is currently active in your apple developer account, then it will just use the same certificate. If the certificate doesn’t match the currently-active one, or you haven’t provided a certificate, you will be prompted to overwrite the old certificate with a new one.

![Prompt to overwrite other certificate](/blog/ios-certificate-wizard/ios-cert-wizard-4.2-overwrite-cert.png)

The same "decisions" need to be made twice: Once for the development certificate, and once for the Apptore certificate.

### App IDs and Provisioning Profiles

The next form in the wizard asks for your app’s bundle ID. This should have been prefilled, but you can change the app ID to a wildcard ID if you prefer.

![Enter the app bundle ID](/blog/ios-certificate-wizard/ios-cert-wizard-5-bundle-id.png)

### Installing Files Locally

Once the wizard is finished generating your provisioning profiles, you should click "Install Locally", which will open a file dialog for you to navigate to a folder in which to store the generated files.

![Select directory to save files in](/blog/ios-certificate-wizard/ios-cert-wizard-7-select-directory.png)

![All done](/blog/ios-certificate-wizard/ios-cert-wizard-8-complete.png)

### Building Your App

After selecting your local install location, and closing the wizard, you should see the fields of the "iOS Signing" properties panel filled in correctly. You should now be able to send iOS debug or Appstore builds without the usual hassles.

## Future Improvements

This wizard is just the next step in our mission to simplify the app-development process. In the next while we’ll be rolling out more features like this. Some planned features include push certificate generation and Appstore uploads. If there are particular aspects of the app development and deployment process that you still find cumbersome, make sure to let us know so we can work on finding solutions.

> Not sure yet what would cause that. If you log into your Apple developer account are there any pending agreements that you have to agree to? Are you able to access the "create certificate form" in your apple developer account? Also, does your account have multiple teams? (i.e. when you log into apple developer to you need to select a team?)

However, I have two test apps and I noticed that after using the wizard to generate certificates for the second app, the first one’s certificates are marked as ‘invalid’ and the app no longer runs on my device. Is this a restriction from Apple or from the wizard?

I have just been testing things out, and whenever I choose to Overwrite the certificate I get an email from Apple saying my certificate has been revoked. What should the general process be? Should each app have its own p12 certificate?

> You need one set of signing certificates for all your apps. You need to renew them once per year as they do expire.
>
> Provisioning profiles are done per-app so when you run the wizard on a new app just tell it NO when it asks to generate the certificates and point the UI to the P12 files you generated last!
>
> Now this is the point where it gets hard… When doing push you DO need new P12 files that are specific to the app, they are totally unrelated to signing/building and are only used for push. So if you check the "push" checkbox you will need to generate those. You will get an automatic email message with instructions when you check that flag.

I can complete the wizard process successfully, but when I’m done I find that it has used the value "password" for my certificate passwords. I don’t want it to use that, how do I specify what password the wizard should use for my certificates? I am using Eclipse. I saw some talk in another thread about setting some project level password but I don’t see that.

> I’m faced with the same problem.. I’m developing 2 apps, been test building on android with no problems and wanted to do test iOS builds, the howto above is great and I was able to send a debug build and install etc.. however when trying to do the same for the second app I’m stuck, I used the same wizard.. _DID_NOT_ create a new signing cert (as I thought it would invalidate the original certs and it looks like I’m correct) and only got the provisioning profiles created. My question is how do we use the same certs for other apps when we dont know the password? I get build errors which I suspect may be caused by the fact that I dont know the password for the certificates in the first place =(

> Apple provides free certificates for educational institutes & non-profits so you might be able to obtain a certificate through one of those venues.
