We are thrilled to announce the immediate availability of Codename One 3.1!  
Version 3.1 is the first release in our fast pace release cycle of 4 releases per year. It brings stability, bug  
fixes and great new features to the table. The biggest highlights of this release are support for Java 8 and simplified  
certificate generation for iOS. Check out the list below for more details. 

### Highlights Of The Release – Click For Details

____Java 8 Language Features

Support for Java 8 features such as Lambdas, try with resources etc. This is a beta  
grade feature but is showing great promise so far.

____iOS Certificate Wizard

Simple generation of certificates and provisioning for itunes  
without a Mac using a wizard interface.

____Font Icons

____Better Crash Reporting

As part of migrating away from Google App Engine we shifted crash reports to use new servers which make  
them far more usable by embedding the logs directly into the email body.
