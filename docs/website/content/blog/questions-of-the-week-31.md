We try to space out plugin updates as much as reasonably possible but unfortunately we need to push out  
an update this week to fix a critical regression in the new GUI builder. Hopefully it is more stable now and we can  
go back to working on new features.

Steve made a couple of very interesting posts this week and we have a few more from him in the coming weeks.

On stack overflow things were as usual:
