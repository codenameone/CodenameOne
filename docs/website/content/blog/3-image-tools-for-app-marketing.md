Every now and again developers ask us how we do the graphics for our posts/promotions and up until recently the  
answer was “photoshop”. While knowing photoshop is still very worthwhile we still like these 3 tools that provide great  
shortcuts to creating both screenshots and art.

### The App Launchpad

[App Launchpad](http://theapplaunchpad.com/) is a newcomer to the scene, it’s still a new tool at the MVP stage.  
The potential is still great and it generates reasonably attractive graphics such as these:

The UX for the tool is reasonably intuitive and you can work on several screenshots at once. There are some missing  
basic features that I’d like to see moving forward but the tool is already pretty useful. E.g. we used it for the kitchensink  
screenshots on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codename1.demos.kitchen) and  
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kitchen-sink-codename-one/id635048865).

Hopefully they will improve the tool by adding:

  * Landscape support

  * Tablet skins

  * Thin fonts

  * More customization abilities e.g. image/texture backgrounds

### Smart Mockups

[Smart Mockups](http://smartmockups.com/) is a [PlaceIt](http://placeit.breezi.com/) clone that isn’t  
as aggressively monetized. It allows you to take a screenshot and place it within a context of a device held by a user.  
Normally this is slightly challenging to do in photoshop unless you have a ready made template.

### Adobe Spark

[Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/) is a tool that makes typography easy. It does quite a few things to generate images  
such as the image above that mix image filters, typography, shape decoration etc.

All of those allow you to create meme style images as well as a wide variety of banners/promo images that you  
can use to market your apps in the stores.

### Good Looking Graphics

The app icon and screenshots are where the initial opinion of your app is formed. If the promotional material isn’t  
good some users will still give your app the benefit of the doubt, but they will do so with a negative first impression.

Good promotional material is no substitute for good app design, but it’s a step that you need to take.

> Nice tips. I wonder whether you’ve tried Promomatic ([https://www.promomatic.com/)](<https://www.promomatic.com/>)) for building app screenshots instead of AppLaunchPad? Super easy to use and cost effective when building for the app store launch. Found them on Product Hunt a few months back.
