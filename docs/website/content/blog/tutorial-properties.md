I’ve [discussed properties](/blog/properties-are-amazing.html) a couple of times before but never in a condensed video tutorial like the one we have here. In this video we review the value proposition behind properties as a step by step process.

I hope to create more elaborate properties demos that would show off the full capabilities of this API.
