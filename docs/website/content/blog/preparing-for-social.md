Codename One 5.0 AKA Social will launch on September 19th. We pushed this release back to include support for crucial features such as JDK 11/OpenJDK support. With these features in place and a slew of other features we are gearing towards 5.0 GA. Tomorrow (Friday) we will push out plugin version 4.5 for all IDE’. This new version is effectively release candidate 1 for the 5.0 version.

Normally we don’t bother with a release candidate this close to an actual release as the plugins don’t change much. However, we made some extensive changes to the plugins recently and we’d like to make sure we didn’t break too many things before the release.

We will enter the release code freeze for social on September 12th after which only reviewed commits can be cherry picked. Only critical bugs will be fixed at that point.

Currently version 6.0 (AKA Chat) is scheduled for release in February 19th 2019.

### Social

We named the releases of Codename One based on the signature app we built on top of that given release. 4.0 was named Taxi as it was used to develop an [Uber clone](https://www.amazon.com/Create-Uber-Clone-Days-mobile-ebook/dp/B07FRXZRRV/). Version 5.0 is named social as we built a [Facebook Clone](https://codenameone.teachable.com/p/build-real-world-full-stack-mobile-apps-in-java) during the release cycle.

For Version 6.0 we will build a whatsapp clone hence the “Chat” moniker.
