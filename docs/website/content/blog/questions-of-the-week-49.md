Next week we’ll resume the bootcamp so I might publish one last blog post after this and that’s it for another two weeks. It’s been ages since our last plugin update so we’ll take this opportunity to release a new plugin release for all the IDE’s together with the other fixes and enhancements coming in this update.

As a sidenote we have a long weekend on the western hemisphere this Friday so our support in the various channels will be a bit limited as a result.

I can write a long post on the new features and enhancements we’ve had over the past couple of weeks that I didn’t cover yet in the previous blog posts this week but I’ll skip this for now. I will also discuss only a few of the stack overflow posts because I didn’t follow as closely as I should. Steve did an amazing job filling in for me over the past 3 weeks and will keep that until May 1st.

[GRV_Droid](http://stackoverflow.com/users/6771390/grv-droid) asked [how to login with Linkedin](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43046675/codename-one-login-with-linkedin) and showing great initiative answered his own question with a solution that works…​ Well done!

[Andrew Snejovski](http://stackoverflow.com/users/7436930/andrew-snejovski) had issues with logging into the certificate wizard. This is a pretty common problem due to [two factor authentication](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43394799/codename-one-ios-certificate-wizard-cant-login) which [Steve](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2935174/steve-hannah) explained while highlighting the workaround and long term solution.

There were many others but it’s hard to go thru the full list and dig thru each one…​
