This material is out of date by now. We recommend checking out the [Codename One Academy](/blog/launching-codename-one-academy.htmls). 

We’ve uploaded the full course video cast as a youtube playlist, just go thru the parts and in an hour and some change you should understand the basics of creating a simple Codename One client server application that runs on all mobile devices.  
  
  
The Udemy course is  
[  
still there  
](https://www.udemy.com/build-mobile-ios-apps-in-java-using-codename-one/)  
and probably useful if you live in a region where youtube is blocked. The source code to accompany the course can be viewed in SVN here:

](https://code.google.com/p/codenameone/source/browse/trunk/Demos/PhotoShare/)  
  
  
  
For your convenience you can also download the projects as a zip
