The material design floating action button is a powerful tool for promoting an action within your application. Quite  
a few Codename One developers implemented with own interpretation of this UI element and with the coming update  
we will have an official implementation.

The `FloatingActionButton` is a round button that resides on top of the UI typically in the bottom right hand side.  
It has a drop shadow to distinguish it from the UI underneath and it can hide two or more additional actions under  
the surface. E.g. we can create a simple single click button such as this:
    
    
    FloatingActionButton fab = FloatingActionButton.createFAB(FontImage.MATERIAL_ADD);
    fab.addActionListener(e -> ToastBar.showErrorMessage("Not implemented yet..."));
    fab.bindFabToContainer(form.getContentPane());

Which will place a `+` sign button that will perform the action. Alternatively we can create a nested action  
where a click on the button will produce a submenu for users to pick from e.g.:
    
    
    FloatingActionButton fab = FloatingActionButton.createFAB(FontImage.MATERIAL_ADD);
    fab.createSubFAB(FontImage.MATERIAL_PEOPLE, "");
    fab.createSubFAB(FontImage.MATERIAL_IMPORT_CONTACTS, "");
    fab.bindFabToContainer(form.getContentPane());

Those familiar with this widget know that there are many nuances to this UI that we might implement/expose  
in the future. At the moment we chose to keep the API simple and minimal for the common use cases and refine  
it based on demand.

> By convention in Codename One right becomes left in RTL mode unless you explicitly disable RTL behavior for that component. I don’t think we tested RTL on the FAB so it might be broken there. I’d expect that code to place the FAB on the left side in Codename One. I’m guessing it doesn’t? How does it look?
