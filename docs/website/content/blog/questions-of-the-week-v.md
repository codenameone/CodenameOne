It has been a very busy week around here with a lot going on. We’ve just sent out the Friday release update  
and we are gearing up for some other interesting things…​ These weekly question posts are really convenient  
as they help us center on what’s truly important – user support.

We had a lot of great questions on stack overflow this week:

### Saving Files in CodenameOne

File systems on mobile are really complex/limited beasts, this often hits desktop developers hard when they  
try to figure out how to adapt desktop paradigms like file pickers etc.

### Image Viewer swipe vertically

Some questions don’t have an answer other than you will have to hack the sources in some way to enable this  
functionality…​

### Callback for Google Play Ads

This question wasn’t answered as much as pointed in a better direction to provide user rewards for ad viewing  
as there is no callback for the Google Play ads.

### Replacing an image in generated Android source code

Codename One doesn’t store images into the standard Android DPI hierarchy as you might have multiple res files  
and download them dynamically in your app. You can however, update a specific multi-image entry as explained  
in the answer below.

### App walkthrough/tutorial when first open

This is a feature we should probably refresh in Codename One and maybe add in one of the demos. The old code  
used the glass pane but it predated the existence of the layered pane which should help significantly. We’ll keep  
that in mind as we are reviewing the demos.

### Date Time Picker issue

Picker is implemented natively on the device. The DateTime picker is a platform specific concept in iOS. Every  
time I need to deal with the [Picker class](/javadoc/com/codename1/ui/spinner/Picker/)  
I’m reminded on how good we have it thanks to lightweight architecture.

### Set path to look for java.exe in the intellij codename plugin

This is a weird IntelliJ IDEA behavior, some oddities still exist in the plugin for IntelliJ in part because the rewrite  
is so new and in part because of our restrictions to project structure.
