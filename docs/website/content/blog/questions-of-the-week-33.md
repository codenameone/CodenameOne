This has been a very busy week, we published new information on the [properties approach](/blog/properties.html)  
which I’m excited about but I’m not sure if I can drum up your enthusiasm…​  
Steve made a [big post](/blog/connecting-to-a-mysql-database.html) about mysql support too.

Todays library update includes [new simulator code](/blog/fail-fast-margin-padding-performance.html) that might
