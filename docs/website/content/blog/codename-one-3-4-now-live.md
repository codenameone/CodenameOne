We are thrilled to announce the immediate availability of Codename One 3.4!

Version 3.4 brings with it refinement and stability as its core features, this is a trend that we are very pleased with  
and intend to carry on to version 3.5.

### Highlights of this Release

  * **Rewritten documentation** – the [developer guide](https://www.codenameone.com/manual/) was  
[written from the ground up](https://www.codenameone.com/files/developer-guide.pdf)  
and the [JavaDocs](https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/) were significantly improved

  * **IntelliJ IDEA Plugin rewrite** – the new [IntelliJ IDEA support](/blog/a-new-idea.html) is  
as good as the NetBeans plugin

  * **Shape Clipping** – it is now possible to [clip a graphics context based on an arbitrary shape](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/shape-clipping-bubble-transition.html)

  * **ToastBar** – allows [posting “hints” visually](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/toastbar-gaussian-blur.html) to a hint area

  * **Toolbar** is [now the default](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/toolbar-default-millimeter-sizes-weekly-releases.html) &  
has a refined implementation/usage

  * **SignatureComponent** – allows us to [accept user signatures](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/downloads-callbacks-signature-more.html)

  * **Gaussian Blur** – supported on [images and dialogs](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/downloads-callbacks-signature-more.html)

  * **ParparVM** – now has [better performance in micro-benchmarks](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/seo-gallery-performance-javascript-gradle.html)

You can see the full list of changes to Codename One in [the github repository](https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/commits/master).

### Lowlights

The following are things we are still working on or failed to bring to the front for this release. We are aware of  
them and are working on improving them:

  * Demos – We were supposed to modernize our demos. Almost all of them still use Java 5 and old themes. None  
use the new material design icon fonts. This makes them feel antiquated, we hope to fix this early in the 3.5 cycle

  * Windows port – We actually [made great progress on this](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/new-windows-port.html) &  
also [posted the full source code](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/windows-idea-enum-values-contactsmanager-refresh.html).  
Just yesterday we posted [additional good news on the subject](/blog/windows-phone-8-1-uwp-support.html)!  
However, it’s still incomplete for release and needs quite a bit of work as it is a **huge** task. We are making a lot  
of progress though and we are optimistic that 3.5 could have UWP support.

  * GUI Builder – This is the biggest failure of this release. One of our core goals was to get the GUI builder  
to production grade in 3.5 and we failed with that. It’s much stabler but we can’t call it 1.0 at this time…​  
This is our highest priority right now. We will try to get the GUI builder to 1.0 well before 3.5 is ready and will  
hopefully release/announce it separately.

### Onwards to 3.5

Besides the lowlights above which must be addressed, there are several other things we are looking at for 3.5:

  * Java 8 all the way – we will make Java 8 into the default build mode. Once that is in order we will experiment  
with “only” Java 8 mode for newer builds.  
Assuming this will work we will switch to Java 8 thru our entire stack and Codename One builtin code will be able  
to use Java 8 language features.

  * Videos & Even Better Docs – We will increase our video output now that our documentation has improved. We  
are still working on even better documentation than what we have right now. We’re not ready for announcements  
yet but we have some interesting ideas

  * We will continue the trend of using Codename One to build everything. This trend started with the  
certificate wizard which is one of our most popular features. It continued with the new GUI builder and preferences  
dialog for our [IntelliJ IDEA support](/blog/a-new-idea.html).

#### Schedule

Codename One 3.5 is scheduled for Tuesday August 2nd 2016. Version 3.6 is currently scheduled for December of  
2016.

> We released the update last week so libraries should be up to date. The Eclipse and IDEA plugins should be at the right version, however since NetBeans goes thru manual verification by the NetBeans team it sometimes take a while for the update (which we submitted almost a week ago) to go thru that process.

> Hi Geertjan,  
> I think I see an issue with the plugin center. is it possible that the plugin center won’t return the most latest plugin version if a user haven’t updated for a while? for example if a User was on version 3.3.3 and he haven’t updated the plugin for a while and in the meantime we uploaded 3.4.0 version. when he search for updates the plugin center will updated him to 3.3.4 instead of skipping that version and offering 3.4.0. is this a known issue?
