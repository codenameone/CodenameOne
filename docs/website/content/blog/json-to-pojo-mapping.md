While the  
[  
webservice wizard  
](/how-do-i---access-remote-webservices-perform-operations-on-the-server.html)  
in Codename One is pretty useful for many things it still requires a proxy and Servlet container which might not be the right choice for everyone. Steve Hannah, created a pretty cool set of tools to map POJO’s (plain old Java objects) to JSON structures by using compile time object mapping. This eliminates the costs/issues of reflection while still delivering a programming experience that is on par with the one we get from Java SE webservice mappings. 

Steve wrote a  
[  
pretty thorough tutorial  
](http://sjhannah.com/blog/?p=366)  
on this as well as a webcast posted below.
