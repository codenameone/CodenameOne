I’m writing this from the lobby of the Hilton hosting the JavaOne conference a bit jetlagged,  
[  
Geertjan  
](https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/)  
invited me to speak at the NetBeans day which was great. However, the best thing was meeting  
[  
James Gosling  
](http://nighthacks.com)  
and talking to him about Codename One! 

I had a lot of doubts about making the trip so soon after  
[  
JavaZone trip  
](http://www.codenameone.com/3/post/2013/09/javazone-trip-report.html)  
but  
[  
Geertjan  
](https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/)  
convinced me by mentioning that there is a chance of meeting  
[  
Gosling  
](http://nighthacks.com)  
which was pretty much the thing that convinced me. So for me the trip is now a huge success.

I’ve also got a chance to meet  
[  
Arno  
](http://www.puder.org/)  
again which is great, I was hoping for more face time with him so we could actually do some coding together but he had some unfortunate scheduling conflicts at the last moment. This is really important for me since we are currently in the position of re-evaluating and reimagining our iOS infrastructure especially in terms of graphics but also in VM capabilities.

Met a lot of great people and companies around here so far, too many to mention. I’ll try to write a more detailed report as the conference winds down.
