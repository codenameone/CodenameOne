Codename One 6.0 AKA Chat will launch on February 27th. We’re pushing this release a week back to finish the open issues. We will enter code freeze on the 20th exactly one week from today.  
After the code freeze only reviewed commits can be cherry picked. Only critical bugs will be fixed at that point.

### Chat

We named the releases of Codename One based on the signature app we built on top of that given release. 5.0 was named social and 4.0 was named Taxi representing the Facebook/Uber clones respectively. Version 6.0 is named Chat as we built a [WhatsApp Clone](https://codenameone.teachable.com/p/build-real-world-full-stack-mobile-apps-in-java) during the release cycle.

For Version 7.0 we plan to build a Netflix clone. The planned name for version 7.0 is “Video”.
