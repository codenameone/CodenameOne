We just released an initial preview of  
[  
Codename One Maker into Google Play  
](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codenameone.apps.maker)  
to start soliciting feedback on what we got wrong and what we need to improve. Let us know what you think and how we can improve it in the future. 

  
We already intend to produce some of the following:  
  

  1.   
Drag and drop form builder – this won’t be a full fledged GUI builder (which requires real coding) but rather a simple way to create custom forms  

  2.   
Plugins – will allow Codename One developers to create libraries that can be integrated into the built applications!  

  3.   
Downloadable themes  

  4.   
On device theme customization/creation  

  5.   
Wizards to create more fleshed out applications from websites, blogs and social networks  

What do you think is most important, what do you think is missing?

  
As a side note we submitted the app to Apple and got rejected because we aren’t allowed to mention any other platforms on iOS (no blackberry or android mention). So the iOS users would only be able to build iOS apps (assuming we get approved)… Thanks Apple.
