As the JavaScript port has matured we started adding new [demos](/demos.html) specifically for  
the [clock demo](/clock-demo/),  
[charts](/charts-demo/) & [GeoViz](/geoviz-demo/). You can now  
see all of them live on the web and also try the Android or desktop versions of these demos to get a better grasp of  
what Codename One can do and how far has the JavaScript build advanced since our 3.0 release. 

#### Plugin Update

We wanted to release the plugin update this week but we ended up postponing to June 1st. As a reminder June  
1st would also be past the deadline for our [annual subscription  
rebate promotion](/blog/codename-one-3-0-now-live.html) as well as the [price change for basic subscriptions](/blog/aligning-prices.html).  
Make sure to take advantage of existing prices/promotions before that date.
