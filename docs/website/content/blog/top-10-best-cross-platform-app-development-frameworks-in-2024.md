To give you an overview, let’s look at the comparison between native and cross-platform across various important factors.

| Factors | Native App Development | Cross-Platform App Development |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | Different apps for different platforms | One app for multiple platforms |
| Cost | High cost of development | Relatively low cost of development |
| Code Reusability | Almost none, code works for a single platform | Single code can be used on multiple platforms, for an easy portability |
| Hardware Access | Complete hardware accessibility with platform SDKs | Limited access to all device APIs |
| UI/UX | Consistent & platform specific UI/UX | Unified UI/UX for all platforms with limited consistency |
| Performance | Seamless, fully native performance | High performance, native-like |
| Target Audience | Limited to a specific platform | Reach a large number of users |
| Time to Market | More time required as need to write different code | Significantly reduced time to market due to single codebase |

### What are the Benefits of Cross-Platform App Development Frameworks?

Here are some of the upsides of cross-platform app development frameworks.

## Code Reusability

Possibly the biggest upside of cross-platform app development frameworks is code reusability. Developers just need to code once and that codebase can be reused to deploy the app to multiple platforms. This concept is commonly referred to as ****“Write Once Run Anywhere”**** or WORA.

WORA eliminates repetition, and in turn, saves operational costs. A shared codebase also allows you to add another platform at a later point without too much effort.

## Reduced Costs & Resources

Cross-platform app development frameworks help you find a good balance between quality and cost by allowing you to be agile while utilizing a smaller team with one skill set and codebase for multiple platforms. 

****It’s simple math:**** Less time, resources, and efforts spent on app development is directly proportional to lower costs.

## Easy Deployment & Maintenance

Since there’s a single codebase for multiple platforms, developers only need to write and maintain just a single source code. This translates to easy and fast deployment, maintenance, updates, and bug fixes.

When updates are made to the code, they are ****synced**** over multiple platforms and devices instantly, saving time and effort.

## Wider Market Reach

Cross-platform frameworks give you maximum exposure to your target audience by allowing you to deploy your app on ****multiple platforms**** i.e. Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, Web etc. This ensures a wider market reach to potential users.

## Uniform Design

Cross-platform frameworks make it easier to share a unified UI/UX across different platforms, while still respecting platform-specific standards. Offering users a ****consistent experience**** will help them easily recognize and interact with the app on any platform.

Cross-platform app development is less costly as compared to native app development since there's a single codebase, they're quicker to develop and take less QA effort.

Cross-platform apps usually cost $30 to $80+ per hour depending on the requirements and complexity.

How long does it take to make a cross-platform app?

Compared to native apps, cross-platform apps take less time to develop and deploy since there’s only a single codebase for multiple platforms that developers need to write and maintain.

The development time of cross-platform apps depends on several factors such as the complexity, target platforms and technical skills.

### Final Thoughts

Cross-platform app development is the obvious route if you’re looking for code reusability, budget savings, easy maintenance and quick deployment as opposed to native development.

Cross-platform development also makes your code simpler and faster to read, write, maintain, debug, re-use and scale.

When choosing the best cross-platform app development framework, there’s NO one size fits all tool. What’s the best framework for you really depends on your technical skills, preferred programming language, project requirements and the platforms you want to target.

> Thank you for your article! I wouldn’t be sure for Cordova as imo it’s not as great as it used to be due to new frameworks that really surpass it. For example, Flutter which you also mentioned. Flutter definitely wins with its HotReload and automated testing, and more native UI. I’ve read about it recently in this article [link removed], and it looks quite convincing.
