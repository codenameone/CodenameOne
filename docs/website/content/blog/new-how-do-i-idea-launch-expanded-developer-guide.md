If you haven’t checked the  
[  
How Do I?  
](/how-do-i.html)  
section recently check it out now. Its completely redone with a filter tool and every video now has the ability to accept comments right below it which you can use to give out tips to other community members about the usage of a specific feature. There is also a  
[  
new video covering the include sources feature  
](/how-do-i---use-the-include-sources-feature-to-debug-the-native-code-on-iosandroid-etc.html)  
and how to debug a Codename One iOS application on xcode with the native device/simulator.  
  
  
Apparently the old i18n How Do I video  
  
that I recorded ages ago slipped between the cracks and never made it to the how do I page either so  
[  
its now there as well  
](/how-do-i---localizetranslate-my-application-apply-i18nl10n-internationalizationlocalization-to-my-app.html)  
. 

  
We updated the Codename One developer guide with more than 50 additional pages passing the 200 page mark  
  
, we will update that guide as part of the 2.0 release.

  
The IDEA plugin is also generally available now and includes its own  
[  
getting started video  
](/how-do-i---create-a-basic-hello-world-application--send-it-to-my-device-using-intellij-idea.html)  
guide.

> Its in my todo list but its pretty low in the queue since we have quite a lot of other priorities. Animations should be very well documented in the developer guide though, what don’t you understand?

> This was broken by IDEA 13 which seems to have a Windows specific bug there, we filed an issue on that. The images don’t show but the dialog should work as usual.

> I’m using IDEA on Mac (Lion) and I see the images with the latest plugin, which JDK are you using?
