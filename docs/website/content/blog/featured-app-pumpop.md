Pumpop is a social networking app in the spirit of tinder that is available globally and installed on many devices  
all over the world. One of its major draws is it’s portability which will soon extend to Windows Phone as well.

Pumpop uses social login controls such as native Facebook login as well as email activation.

__ |  If you are in a committed relationship I suggest notifying your spouse that you are “just testing this app for work”,  
to avoid unpleasantness and suspicion…​

### Contributions

One of the things that should be mentioned about the guys from Pumpop is that they “walk the walk”.  
Fabricio of [pmovil](http://www.pmovil.com) (the company behind Pumpop) has contributed a great deal of code  
to the Codename One community most of which is shown in their [github profile](https://github.com/Pmovil/).

Fabricio contributed multiple cn1libs ranging in functionality from [native Toast support](https://github.com/Pmovil/Toast)  
to [comscore analytics](https://github.com/Pmovil/comScore). But his biggest work has been his  
[custom Windows Phone/UWP port](https://github.com/Pmovil/CN1WindowsPort) which served as a basis  
for our newer port!

That is gumption in it’s true hacker sense and truly represents the open source spirit we try to foster within  
Codename One. If he hadn’t done all of that work we might not have even started with the UWP port effort  
so if you are looking forward to the new Windows support you have Fabricio and Pmovil to thank for that.

> Interesting app. However I noticed an annoying bug though, for example when switching between other apps using the overview button (task switcher) while the chat form is showing, going back to this app again, the message input bar disappears only leaving the typed text visible (tested on android 4.3.1).

> Thanks Ross for the feedback ! I didn’t find it that annoying but it was marked as a bug to be fixed in the next version.

> Hi Fabricio, thats great! Also would it be possible to add in paragraph support for typing in the text conversations? That would be nice :). Another lookout point is whether if its possible to make the UI more native looking to the OS (eg material design for Android etc) by sticking to their guidelines, while still preserving the fun. I also noticed a slight flickering in the background when menu actions are accessed and the action list box sometimes get stuck at the bottom when the keyboard is minimized and the screen maximized. Good luck! Looking forward to the next update..Ross.
