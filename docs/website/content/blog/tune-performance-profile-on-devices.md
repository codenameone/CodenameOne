I promised 2 new course modules for February and just published the second one. In case you don’t recall I discussed the first one [here](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/use-open-source-build-offline.html) and it covered building Codename One applications from the open source code.  
This new module goes through seven lessons that cover everything you need to know when building a performant app. It covers everything from generic performance tips/analysis all the way to profiling and a case study. You can check out the full module in the [Deep Dive into Mobile Programming](https://codenameone.teachable.com/p/deep-dive-into-mobile-development-with-codename-one) course in the academy.

__ |  The deep dive course is bundled into the full [Build real world full stack mobile apps](https://codenameone.teachable.com/p/build-real-world-full-stack-mobile-apps-in-java) course for free!

Together with the [offline build](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/use-open-source-build-offline.html) course I added 2 hours of additional material this month alone.

This opens the question of where do we go from here?

I’m still weighing some ideas for the module I’ll release in March. I would also like you to help me pick the following apps after that…​

With that in mind I’m publishing a new survey which I would hope you can help me with [here](https://goo.gl/forms/8tsIt5Z7Wr9KbiTz1).

This will help me create new content that better suits the apps you are trying to build.
