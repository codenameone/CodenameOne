We finally uploaded the last of the 3 hello world videos covering  
[Eclipse](/how-do-i---create-a-basic-hello-world-application—​send-it-to-my-device-using-eclipse.html),  
which now joins the ranks of the  
[NetBeans](/how-do-i---create-a-basic-hello-world-application—​send-it-to-my-device-using-netbeans.html) and  
[IntelliJ/IDEA](/how-do-i---create-a-basic-hello-world-application—​send-it-to-my-device-using-intellij-idea.html)  
videos.

Check out the Eclipse version here:

These are probably the three most important videos we have which is why we decided to start with them as  
part of our restructuring of our video tutorials & guides. Now that we got them out of the way we need to decide  
on the next high priority video?

Should we focus on re-doing one of our existing videos that is badly done or create a completely new video?

Currently I’m leaning towards the latter as I think we are missing a “How does Codename One work?” video  
which might go a long way to explain some basic concepts that are hard to explain with the current set  
of materials. If you have other thoughts or things you would like to see featured in future videos please let us know.
