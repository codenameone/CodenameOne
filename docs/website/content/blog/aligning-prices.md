Our pricing has been inconsistent with the rest of the industry for quite some time specifically the price of the  
basic subscription which is a losing tier. Based on Industry norms the basic subscription should be far more  
expensive and doesn’t come close to covering the costs of running Codename One’s extensive cloud  
infrastructure. So on June 1st we will raise the price of the basic subscription to 19USD which is still very  
affordable. Notice that **if you are a current subscriber or sign up before June 1st you can keep paying  
at the 9USD rate!**  
However, if you let your subscription lapse we will not be able to recover it and you would need to switch to the 19USD  
level… 

This is an important step for the health of the company as the costs of hosting our infrastructure are growing fast  
and basic subscriptions just aren’t carrying the weight. 

As part of this move we also analyzed our build server usage and noticed many developers in the free tier who  
place a very heavy toll on the build servers with long builds that eventually cost in service degradation to everyone.  
That is one of the reasons we originally made the iOS build quota so limiting… 

So we are now reducing the credits for iOS builds to 8 credits per build (from 20) but also placing a size quotas on  
builds from free users to reduce both our storage costs and build times (upload/download and server instance costs).  
We are sure this step will improve performance for everyone involved and help people try Codename One before  
committing to a paid account.

> @codenameone:disqus : I totally understand that you can’t offer everything for free. It’s impossible for a company to do everything for free. That doesn’t wipe away my wish to have a good product for less :).
>
> @fabriciocabeca:disqus I wish I could choose. I have time to make a build server and if everything is set up well once, I only have to keep everything up to date. Sometimes I prefer to have my own server to be not dependent of Codename One (that’s actually one of the drawbacks for me, the dependence of the company).

> So, just to clarify, if I pay 9USD before end of this month, how much will I pay at end of June? 19USD or still 9USD? Also, why don’t you also include an option for annual or 6 month subscriptions for Basic users to help us save cost for monthly transactions fees?

> That email was poorly worded IMO. It was sent without my review.  
> The limit applies to the built JAR before sending otherwise it would be meaningless since the servers would have had to do all the work (and wasted the paid quotas we are spending) so there would have been no saving.  
> To be clear we didn’t just pull out that number, we reviewed the sizes of free user builds coming in and concluded that well over 90% would fit under this limit right now or with very small modifications. The goal is to stop the outliers so we can provide essentially more quota (e.g. increased iOS build credits). Things like the kitchen sink demo which is really wasteful (several huge themes, a video etc.) will not fit, but its not a common app.

> The resource file can only have the theme which can be bigger than 1Mb. This resource file is always added to the jar file before sending so the problem persist because a very simple app with a custom theme will not fit too because of the size of the theme file. How can you resolve that?

> You can dynamically download a theme on the device to workaround that but yest that is something that won’t work as well…  
> Most themes should be optimizable see: [http://codenameone.com/blog…](<http://codenameone.com/blog/shrinking-sizes-optimizing.html>)
>
> Unfortunately more elaborate themes won’t make it in. The main problem is that we can’t really tell how large your code is and how large the theme is (before doing all the work) and even if we could it would still cost us quite a bit more to build/host larger files. We tried to draw a line that makes sense for most and would allow us the leverage to increase build quotas which we felt were lacking.

> Shai, you must make a poll to users to know if they want more ios buid quotas or more app size. It’s not good to decide for users. If you cannot know the size of the code in the jar file so your first answer is not the right answer. You can not limit us if you cannot just track the size of our code without the resource file. This a serious problem that you create for developers

> Resource files when packaged to the jar are reduced by size, besides plenty of complex themes are in the 400-500k range uncompressed.  
> This should be sufficient for a user to properly evaluate the product before he/she commits to a paid account.  
> This is a crucial step for the health of the company we need the heavy users to start and help us pay the bills $9 or even $19 is pretty valuable for the product and service we provide.

> I for one totally support this change and understand why it is necessary. Codename one has been more than generous allowing you to build production applications for free for years. A company can’t go on this way forever and afford to stay in business and improve the system. I think it’s great that the free tier will still give people a lot so that they can truly evaluate the platform. I also think it’s more than generous to offer us the 9 price before raising the price. I have subscribed to the basic level now and look forward to developing with Codename one.
