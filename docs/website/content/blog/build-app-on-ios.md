We [launched the Codename One Build App beta on Android last week](/blog/build-app-beta.html) and now we have a public beta for iOS as well. You can sign up to join the public beta through [this link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Y3RxSm81). Notice that you will need testflight on your device to join the public beta test.

As is the case with the Android version please let us know if there are issues you experience in the [issue tracker](http://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/). The app mostly “just worked” on iOS but getting through the approval and submission process is always a pain. As part of that work we also improved the tablet UI which makes the app very usable on the iPad.

We’re refining the app further and hopefully we’ll bring it to production grade soon.
