Finally after all this time you can buy the Uber book today in both in [Kindle and print](https://www.amazon.com/Create-Uber-Clone-Days-mobile/dp/1983258784/) versions!  
Notice that the kindle pricing is currently very low due to Amazon’s restrictions. Once the Amazon exclusivity expires the price of the ebook will go up.

Notice that the book is also available on all Amazon domains so you can order from [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07FRXZRRV), [DE](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07FRXZRRV), [FR](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07FRXZRRV), [ES](https://www.amazon.es/dp/B07FRXZRRV), [IT](https://www.amazon.it/dp/B07FRXZRRV), [NL](https://www.amazon.nl/dp/B07FRXZRRV), [JP](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07FRXZRRV), [BR](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B07FRXZRRV), [CA](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07FRXZRRV), [MX](https://www.amazon.com.mx/dp/B07FRXZRRV), [AU](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07FRXZRRV) and [IN](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07FRXZRRV).

Notice that the print book should also be available in local stores, but you’ll probably need to ask the store to stock it. For now the book won’t launch on other digital stores due to Amazon exclusivity, I’m not sure when/if this will change.

You can check out the first two chapters at [the book site](https://uber.cn1.co/). Please spread this far and wide, if the book is a success I’ll turn it into a series featuring other apps as well.

### JDK 11

In unrelated news, this weekend we’ll release experimental support for JDK 9, 10 and 11. This support means Codename One will work when running on these JDK’s (and OpenJDK) but it doesn’t mean that Codename One will add features from these JDK’s.

If you have a newer JDK on your machine we’d appreciate issues covering this support. We’re releasing it early to give us time to test it until the 5.0 release.

It’s an important feature as JDK 8 reaches end of life at the end of the year.

> Yes on all counts with the plugin that comes out tomorrow (including JDK 11). We did our testing but it was relatively limited so we hope people will let us know how well this works (or doesn’t work). We also use these newer JDK’s in our continuous integration tests.

> I will produce 8 apps for the course out of which I delivered 2 (in addition to the 2+ already there beforehand). The next app would be a whatsapp clone which will launch in 2018. It will be followed by a netflix clone. You can see how this was decided in the survey results [https://www.codenameone.com…](<https://www.codenameone.com/blog/survey-results-2018.html>)

> Hi Shai, Will the upcoming 2019 Java licensing change by Oracle have an effect on Codename One? Is CN1 dependent on Java for developing and deploying apps or is there an alternative Development Tool Kit that supports the cn1 plugin? Please advice! Thanks.

> OpenJDK is the alternative. Its license is free. Also as long as you keep updating the JDK to the latest LTS (currently JDK 11) this shouldn’t be a problem. This is the exact reason we’re moving to support JDK 11.
