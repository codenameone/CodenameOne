Localization and internationalization are probably some of the most important features for a modern app. Most frameworks tuck on localization as an afterthought as authors of such frameworks are often born in the states…​ Codename One integrates localization, deep into the framework.

However, we don’t have an ETA for these updates and I don’t think that’s a valid reason to delay the release any further. One of the nice things with our new video system is that this would be relatively easy to edit with new information as it becomes available…​
