Millions of Codename One apps are installed on devices every month. Most of them aren’t in the gallery  
and are never featured in this recurring segment. We are looking for something exceptional in apps that  
we feature here and [Ana Paltel](/featured-ana-paltel.html) fits that bill. It has a polished UI and it’s  
shipped by a major operator. It uses some unique Codename One features to boot making it even more interesting.

We liked the usage of the native Google Maps integration that provides  
information about service points and directions. The UI as you can see from the screenshots above is  
rich, it provides gauge charts and other visual niceties that are builtin directly into Codename One.

Since the app is localized in Arabic and English it makes use of Codename One’s native bidi/RTL support  
which is essential for middle eastern languages. It also makes use of push notification and a few other  
device capabilities.

The app is shipping both on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/dm/app/ana-paltel/id1131291631) & on  
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paltel.mobapp) and as of this time  
it’s open to users in other regions so I was able to install it and take it to a spin. Even thought I couldn’t  
physically login there is a lot of functionality that’s exposed on the guest account.
