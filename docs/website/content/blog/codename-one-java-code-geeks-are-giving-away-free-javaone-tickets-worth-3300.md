> However, J1 has a discover pass that doesn’t allow much and should cost roughly $50. It allows you to see the pavilion booths and the big announcements/general sessions (if I remember correctly). I’m not sure if this is something you can buy via Oracles site, if not we might be able to provide you with access to such a pass.
