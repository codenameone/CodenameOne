The last time we had a developer economics survey you guys really came thru and made us one of the top contributors for that survey!  
  
  
This year the stakes are even higher and the incentive for referrals  
  
is greater, if you want to help us promote Codename One to a people outside of the core Java developer community then please fill out this survey using this link:  
[  
http://www.vmob.me/DE3Q14CodenameOne  
](http://www.vmob.me/DE3Q14CodenameOne)  
. Please also help us by distributing this link as far as you can!  
  
  
  
  
The guys at Developer Economics are also offering rewards for people who complete the forms so the incentive should be even greater!  
  
  
  
  
Thanks for taking the time to fill this out.
