We supported native widgets within the [native interface](/how-do-i---access-native-device-functionality-invoke-native-interfaces.html) feature since the first public beta. However, this requires native coding and isn’t always trivial. Normally you don’t really need to do that.

E.g. for text fields we implicitly convert the field to a native field as necessary.

However, if you wish to use the password manager of the device this won’t work. To solve this Steve introduced a new cn1lib: [cn1-native-controls](https://github.com/shannah/cn1-native-controls). This library wraps some native widgets and lets us use some features that might be tricky without them. Good use cases for this include the password managers which need a native text widget constantly in that sport. Another use case would be iOS’s SMS interception text field that can automatically intercept the next incoming SMS and set it to a special native text field.

There are currently two widgets in this library:

  * `NSelect` — which acts like a combo box

  * `NTextField` — which is practically a drop-in replacement for `TextField`

You can use the `NTextField` like this:
    
    
    hi.add("Text fields");
    hi.add("Username:");
    NTextField tf1 = new NTextField(TextField.USERNAME);
    System.out.println("Setting font to main light 15mm");
    tf1.getAllStyles().setFont(Font.createTrueTypeFont(Font.NATIVE_MAIN_LIGHT, 15f));
    System.out.println("Finished setting font");
    tf1.getAllStyles().setFgColor(0x003300);
    tf1.getAllStyles().setBgTransparency(255);
    tf1.getAllStyles().setBgColor(0xcccccc);
    tf1.getAllStyles().setAlignment(CENTER);
    hi.add(tf1);
    hi.add("Password:");
    NTextField tf2 = new NTextField(TextField.PASSWORD);
    hi.add(tf2);
    hi.add("Email:");
    NTextField emailField = new NTextField(TextField.EMAILADDR);
    hi.add(emailField);
    
    tf1.addActionListener(e->{
        //tf2.setText(tf1.getText());
    });
    tf1.addChangeListener(e->{
       result.setText(tf1.getText());
       hi.revalidateWithAnimationSafety();
    });
    tf2.addActionListener(e->{
        Log.p("Action listener fired on password field");
        result.setText(tf2.getText());
        hi.revalidateWithAnimationSafety();
    });
    tf2.addDoneListener(e->{
        Log.p("Done was clicked!!!");
    });

> I compared my class paths with the KitchenSink example, and realized I had deleted the lib/impl/, override/ and native/internal_tmp folders. I added them manually, and now it works. That reminded me of somewhere in the CN1 manual there’s a screenshot of the class path list in Netbeans saying don’t change this if you don’t know what you’re doing – I now realize why 🙂 Thanks a lot for pointing me in the right direction.

> I would like to use the NTextField in the login screen, and when that screen is shown, automatically enter edit mode for the email field. With a normal TextField I can use Form.setEditOnShow(emailField), but it doesn’t accept the NTextField. Is there some way to achieve the same effect when using the NTextField?

> No you can’t use it like that. However, you can add an onShow listener and start editing at that point which should be equivalent.
