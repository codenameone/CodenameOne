We’ve discussed [codapps.io](http://codapps.io/) before, it’s a MOOC (online course) that allows you to learn Java  
programming and uses mobile/Codename One as its vehicle. Our current documentation and tutorials can be quite  
intimidating to a person who is a complete Java newbie so this course is quite helpful in bridging that gap.

I think learning GUI programming is probably the best way to learn programming as it lets you “see” the results  
instantly and experiment.

The [codapps.io](http://codapps.io/) MOOC focuses on typical apps created with the GUI builder and tries to smooth  
the entry into the lower level Java coding.

Another interesting tutorial for complete beginners is from Loke Hansen and we discussed it  
[here](/blog/how-to-build-a-clicking-tapping-game-tutorial.html). Hansen created a series of tutorials  
covering the process of building a game from scratch without any experience in Java. He explains a lot of  
complex details very clearly and because this is a game the course is both entertaining and goal oriented!

### Other Resources

We have a lot of documentation, but picking up a 900 page [developer guide](/manual/) might be intimidating  
when you are completely new to Java.

Here are some helpful resources to get you started:

  * [Component Gallery](https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/com/codename1/ui/package-summary.html) – shows  
the common components that are a part of Codename One in a visual index

  * [Layout gallery](https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/com/codename1/ui/layouts/package-summary.html) –  
layouts are one of the hardest concepts to grasp in Codename One, this visual gallery covers the basic Codename One  
layout managers

  * [JavaDoc](https://www.codenameone.com/javadoc/) – the JavaDoc is a standard “reference guide” to the Codename One  
API and what’s available in it you can search any method/class by clicking one of the index files  
Developer guide

  * [Demos](/demos.html) – the Codename One demos e.g. the [Kitchen Sink](/kitchen-sink/) are a  
great place to start. You can create most demos by just going thru the wizard process by selecting  
New Project → Codename One → Demos →#Name of demo#

### Help

Stack overflow is the best place to ask for help but it can sometimes be intimidating as you need to ask in the “right way”  
& that can be difficult when you don’t know anything. Try asking on the [discussion forum](/discussion-forum.html)  
notice that sometimes things get flagged as SPAM by the automatic Google filters. To avoid that you should probably  
join the group before posting and use a verified gmail account.

I learned Java by reverse engineering the first public beta and a lot of experimentation 20 years ago. Things that  
are obvious to me might be baffling to people making their first steps into programming…​  
When you ask a question keep in mind that sometimes we might be detached from your current experience level  
and guide us toward the type of answer you need.

Keep in mind that engineering, math and all such disciplines eventually boil down to patience. Putting in the hours,  
effort and asking for help when necessary will eventually pay off.
