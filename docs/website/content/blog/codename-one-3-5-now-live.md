We are thrilled to announce the immediate availability of Codename One 3.5!

Version 3.5 is a **huge** release that includes the long awaited Windows Universal Platform (UWP) support and brings the new GUI builder out of beta.

### Highlights of this Release

  * **Beta version of the UWP (Universal Windows Platform) Port** – Codename One [supports native Windows 10 universal apps](/manual/appendix-uwp/) that you can sell thru the Windows Store

  * **New GUI Builder Release** – We released the [new GUI builder](/blog/using-the-new-gui-builder/). It still has rough edges but is improving at a rapid pace

  * **New Settings UI featuring the Extensions Library** – This is a complete [redesign of the core settings/preferences](http://www.codenameone.com/blog/new-preferences-command-state-localization-locking.html) within Codename One. It started as the settings UI for IntelliJ/IDEA and we liked it so much we decided to make it the default for all IDE’s. This tool makes the process of [installing/discovering cn1libs (libraries/extensions/plugins)](http://www.codenameone.com/blog/automatically-install-update-distribute-cn1libs-extensions.html) trivial!

  * **Experimental New Peer Component Mode** – We now allow [more elaborate lightweight heavyweight mixing mode](http://www.codenameone.com/blog/new-android-peer-mode.html) on the Android port and soon on other ports

  * **Seamless support for Android Marshmallow permissions** – This requires [no code changes](/blog/switching-on-android-marshmallow-permission-prompts/) for most applications. We also support this in the [simulator & native code](/blog/marshmallow-permissions-in-the-simulator-and-native-code/).

  * **Removed Skins from Simulator** – We [moved skins to the more menu](/blog/unskin-proxy-support/) where you can be download them dynamically. We also added new skins and a [skin designer tool](/blog/skin-designer/)…​  
This reduced the size of our distribution by almost 30MB!

  * **Added Background Fetch Support** – This allows [downloading in the background in iOS/Android](http://www.codenameone.com/blog/background-fetch.html)

  * **New Accordion Component** – Allows [folding/expanding UI elements](/blog/accordion-component/)

  * **New ComponentAnimation methods for Compound Animations** – allow more [elaborate animation effects](/blog/composite-animations/)

  * **Material Icons Enhancements** – [used thru the code](/blog/toolbar-back-easier-material-icons/) and map to [different component selection states](http://www.codenameone.com/blog/pressed-selected-icon-font-utf-8.html) seamlessly

  * **Search Command in the Toolbar** – It’s now trivial to [add search](/blog/toolbar-search-mode/) into the title area

  * **Proxy Support** – [for simulator & build process](/blog/unskin-proxy-support/)

  * **Demos Rewritten** – we rewrote/revisited the following demos: [Property Cross](/blog/property-cross-revisited/), [Charts](/blog/charts-demo-revisited/), [Social Boo](/blog/social-boo-revisited/), [Dr. Sbaitso](http://www.codenameone.com/blog/dr-sbaitso-revisited.html), [Chrome](/blog/chrome-demo/),  
[Clock](/blog/clock-demo/) & [Camera](/blog/camera-demo/). They are now all Java 8 based, they use the newer API’s such Toolbar and proper fonts.

  * **Simplified ToastBar** – Added [simple error message handling](/blog/zip-and-toast/), regular [messages](/blog/toastbar-messages/) and [download progress indication](/blog/toast-downloads/)

  * **Finished migration to the new push servers** – the last few users are leaving and [soon the old servers will be retired](/blog/migration-to-the-new-push-servers-completed/)

### Lowlights

  * Xcode 7 migration – this is something we tried to do and had to walk back. It’s more challenging to get this right but we hope to do this in the 3.6 cycle.

  * Demos – we didn’t finish all the demos and didn’t finish the most important one (Kitchen Sink). There isn’t much left there though…​

  * Peer Component Support – we didn’t switch this on by default. We weren’t able to do this for other OS’s either in time for the release.

  * While we produced videos we didn’t produce more of them. The production of higher quality videos is more intense and hard to fit into our schedules

### Onwards to 3.6

With 3.6 we are aiming to introduce an offline build option for enterprise developers. We also have some other plans but they might stretch to 3.7.

The lowlight issues above are important to us for the 3.6 release and we’d like to improve on them.

#### Schedule

Version 3.6 is scheduled for December of 2016. 3.7 is scheduled for April 4th 2017.
