I’ve been working on a book form of the Uber Clone module in the course. I finished the principal writing quite a while back but unlike the course a book requires more back and forth. I’ve already gone through the first review cycle and it has made the book much better as a result. There is still a lot to do as I would like the result to be sublime.

As part of that process I’ll publish the first few chapters of the book here which I hope would be helpful and provide feedback from you guys…​

The first couple of chapters are an introduction to Codename One and I think they are far better written than anything we have out there right now.

People who purchased the full [online course](https://codenameone.teachable.com/p/build-real-world-full-stack-mobile-apps-in-java) will get free access to the book within a couple of months after publication (once exclusivity expires). At that time I will embed the book into the course with the other materials.

While the writing itself is quite easy the production aspect is a pain in the neck. Hopefully this book will succeed and if it does I’ll keep doing additional ones which should be easier now that I have the process mostly ironed out.
