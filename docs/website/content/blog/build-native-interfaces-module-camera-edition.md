I discussed the new [Camera cn1lib last week](/blog/camerakit-low-level-camera-api.html). One of the motivations for doing it (besides the request from an enterprise account) was that of a new course module. Last week I added a [new module](https://codenameone.teachable.com/p/deep-dive-into-mobile-development-with-codename-one) covering the process of building the camera cn1lib…​  
We have several online videos (both in the course and outside of it) covering native interfaces. So why do we need another one?

Working with native code is error prone & complex. A lot of the tutorials we built in the past ended up spending more time on configuration issues than on code.  
In this module I talked a lot about Objective-C, callbacks, delegates & more. If you are thinking about native integration this helps give a more rounded view of the options.
