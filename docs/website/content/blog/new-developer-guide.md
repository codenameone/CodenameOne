We are rebuilding the [developer guide](/manual/) using JBake and asciidoc which means the guide would be better integrated  
into the website thus providing more accessible hyperlinkable information. This is already making its way into  
the site and into the PDF so we’d appreciate feedback. 

This is still work in progress where we integrate the information that we conveyed in the blog over the past 18 months  
into the guide, this is a lengthy process since the information needs to be edited into a more formal structure  
and updated with changes. Hopefully we will complete all this work by the release of 3.0 which is approaching fast.
