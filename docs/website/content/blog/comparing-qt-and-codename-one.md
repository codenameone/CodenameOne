We get a lot of requests to compare Codename One to other technologies and while we do have a comparison  
page it is somewhat static. Doing a comparison within a blog post does have the advantage of focusing on  
one technology and allowing comments. In this segment we’ll compare the venerable QT to Codename One.

When developers started asking for this comparison I was of the opinion that it made no sense. The technologies  
are so far apart from one another that they defy any sensible comparison. I still think the conceptual difference is  
a bit too great but I’ll try to bridge some of the gap.

__ |  We updated this comparison after the initial publication to include the additional Property Cross section   
---|---  
  
__ |  We updated this again to reflect pricing, terms & lightweight/heavyweight mixing   
---|---  
  
### Background

QT went thru a lot over it’s many years. It’s the basis of the excellent KDE Linux desktop environment which in  
my humble opinion was always superior to gnome. It’s a C++ library & toolchain developed by a company called  
Trolltech that was purchased by Nokia.

Nokia purchased Trolltech with the goal of taking QT into mobile, this went thru many iterations over the years  
but the product that’s available today is radically different to everything available since.

### At a Glance

Table 1. QT vs. Codename One Category | QT | Codename One  
---|---|---  
Language |  C++/QML-JavaScript |  Java  
Cloud Build |  No (requires Mac & Windows for full OS support) |  Yes (can work on Linux for iOS development)  
IDE |  QT Creator or Visual Studio |  NetBeans, Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA  
Web Deployment |  No |  Yes  
Widgets |  Lightweight |  Lightweight  
Pricing (Monthly no discounts) |  350 USD |  19 USD – 399 USD + Free  
App Distribution |  Only with active subscription |  Perpetual  
  
### In Detail

#### Language

While QT supports QML (an XML flavor) with JavaScript bindings. QT at it’s base is C based. If you need to integrate a native widget like Googles native maps or similar capabilities you need to do this via C.

This might be challenging as most of the integration documentation for various libraries is in Java, Objective-C.  
Binding an iOS/Android SDK to QT might not be trivial. C++ isn’t garbage collected or "safe" and is a challenging  
language for novices.

Codename One uses Java for everything with all of the typical Java advantages (GC, safe memory etc.). When  
integrating with native code Codename One generates "stubs" for the various platforms allowing developers to  
write native Objective-C, Java (Android flavor), C# etc. code.

This makes integrating with native OS capabilities far simpler as developers can literally copy and paste sample  
code from the SDK vendor.

#### Pricing & Rights

QT is free for open source GPL projects. For every other case it’s priced at 295USD per developer.

Codename One has a free commercial license and a full license starts at 19USD.

Codename One sees the apps as owned by you, once built you are free to sell and redistribute them even after canceling a subscription. QT [requires](https://www.qt.io/faq/) licensing fees for distribution. If you stop paying the monthly licensing fee you need to stop distributing the applications you’ve already built.

#### Cloud Build

Codename One’s cloud build capability is unique. It allows developers to build a native application using the  
Codename One cloud servers (Macs for iOS, Windows machines for Windows etc.) This removes the need to  
own dedicated hardware and allows you to build native iOS apps from Windows and native Windows apps  
from your Mac or Linux machine.

This makes the installation of Codename One trivial, a single plugin to install. This isn’t true for development  
environments that don’t use that approach.

#### IDE

QT has its own custom IDE with GUI builder. It also has a plugin to support Visual Studio which is quite popular  
in the C++ developer community.

Codename One integrates with all major Java IDE’s thru a standard plugin. The plugin delivers the simulators  
and visual tools for Codename One as well as the device building capabilities.

#### Web Deployment

QT is very portable and so is Codename One. Both support many platforms but there is one that Codename One  
can support that QT might find unreachable: JavaScript.

Codename One supports the process of compiling an application (threads and all) into a JavaScript application  
that can be hosted on the web. This is done by statically translating the Java bytecode to JavaScript obfuscated  
code.

#### Widgets

The one point of similarity between QT and Codename One is that both frameworks take the lighweight widget  
approach for greater flexibility and portability. However, as far as I can tell only Codename One supports lightweight/heavyweight mixing.

Integrating a component like Goolge Maps into QT and drawing on top of it will require a lot of work. This is seamless in the current version of Codename One.

### Property Cross Comparison

The PropertyCross demo was built as a tool that allows us to compare two cross platform frameworks, as such  
there are versions of the demo for many such platforms. You can check out details of the Codename One  
implementation [here](/blog/property-cross-revisited.html). The github repository for this demo  
is [here](https://github.com/codenameone/PropertyCross/).

The [QT version of property cross](https://github.com/tastejs/PropertyCross/tree/master/qt) includes 3 projects:  
– The main application QML UI – this includes code that is mostly declarative but quite a lot of it. It defines the UI  
of the application and not much more  
– The lib directory includes the CPP files and header files for the project  
– A special test project that we’ll ignore for now as this isn’t covered in other discussions

It’s pretty great that QT doesn’t require separate projects for every OS. It does have some theme directories but  
most of the code including the UI is common. This is because QT and Codename One share a lightweight  
architecture that increases portability.

The code isn’t as verbose as some other implementations it is roughly 2x-3x larger than the Codename One  
project in lines of code. The project seems to be missing the application launcher screenshots and the icon files  
for the various supported DPI’s. While most of the resources would probably be adaptable in a portable way  
icons and splash screens probably won’t be.

This is something that Codename One can handle seamlessly thanks to the build servers but QT might have an  
issue with.

### Final Word

Our opinions are obviously biased but I think we did a reasonably fair comparison. I actually like and respect QT  
which makes it a great candidate for comparison.

If you think we misrepresented Codename One or QT in any way let us know in the comments.

Please use the comments section for suggestions of future comparison segments.

>
> E.g. let me give you a nugget, FX fans constantly talk about FX going into VW and making a splash. Guess what, Codename One has shipped in millions of cars for years and we didn’t even mention that ONCE!
>
> If you think FX will pick up because of one deal or another I suggest you take your emotional attachment. Put it in a box and take a step backwards. You might like FX, it’s an elegant API designed by brilliant people for whom I have the utmost respect. But that doesn’t change one iota of the facts I wrote above. I’m waiting anxiously for an itemized list of "lies".

I have also worked on what was recently voted the second best animated film of all time in terms of the rendering and animation quality. I have optimised scene graphs before. I know more about GPU technology than you do about how to behave like a tool. Johan and I could together take down your entire company all by ourselves if you continue to motivate us to do just that.

> Good luck to you guys with gluon, I’m sure you will reach the same level of market success as FX.
>
> Notice that if we fail you will fail too but the opposite isn’t true. We are the established leader in the Java mobile WORA tools but to take that position you need to surpass in acquisitions not take business from us. I hope you have someone who understands how the business side of things works at your company.
>
> We are not your competitor just like you are no threat to us. At most you could in theory slow our growth but if we go down in sales it means the market is shrinking which is bad for us but horrible for you as you aren’t yet established.
>
> I suggest you focus first on understanding "what the market is", it sounds like a "stupid business speak" but I suggest you understand these concepts if you want to succeed. Then take a step back and objectively compare the end user/developer proposition of our respective tools. You will notice that you guys target a very different demo/value proposition. If you carry that analysis to its full extent you will also see what I saw in my first meeting with Niklas at JavaOne 2013. There is no business model for your approach other than consulting.
>
> Consulting can be moderately profitable, but you can’t sustain long term platform development on consulting fees. Eventually you need to pick and choose if you are a consulting shop or a startup and at that point you need to sit down with someone who understands business and try to imagine the growth that’s achievable in realistic scenarios.
