Codename One 3.8 should land one week from now and from later today we are effectively in code freeze. Please update to the release candidate of 3.8 tomorrow morning to help us track some last minute bugs and regressions. As is usually our process we will release updates as necessary with code reviews and next week we won’t have the usual set of releases as we’ll take some time off.

We will branch to the 3.8 branch in our repository and every change to the branch will be cherry picked individually.

During this week of code freeze we’ll try to update the documentation and prepare everything for the release. There are many important features in this release but as is our approach in recent releases the emphasis is strongly on refinement. If you run into any issue please [file the issue](http://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/) ASAP so we can move quickly and update the release if necessary.

### Upcoming Milestones

As you might recall we announced a switch to major version milestones which means the next release is 4.0. Here are the coming releases:

  * 4.0 – Scheduled for March 6th 2018

  * 5.0 – Scheduled for July 17th 2018

  * 6.0 – Scheduled for November 14 2018

You can track these milestones and the related tasks in our github project [here](https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/milestones).

> Yes we will push out the 3.8 manual hopefully next week.  
> We won’t publish it elsewhere since the book is a print on demand book (POD) so Amazon literally does the printing of the book. Submitting to POD is a bit of a painful process so I don’t think we’ll go through other POD shops as well.  
> The PDF is still available and would be in sync with the book so if Amazon isn’t an option you can always print that as a last resort. It’s not ideal but can work.
