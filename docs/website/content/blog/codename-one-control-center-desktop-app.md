We have recently released a new tool named Control Center. Some of you may ask why have we released a new tool? You already have quite a few: IDE plugins, builds dashboard, preferences app, simulator, designer, GUI builder and more.

### Why?

Well the main reason behind this new app is exactly because we have plenty of tools.

The new Control Center App’s aim is to consolidate the many tools we have which will make your life easier and ours much easier to release updates and to introduce new features and support.

### What’s in it?

The first version we are releasing contains the preferences app, the builds dashboard and the support channel. Moving forward we plan to enhance it and move more of the tools into this App.

Please feel free to send us feedback and suggestions how to improve

Happy coding! and a Happy New Year!

> The “Control Center” App replaces the settings app, it is accessible from the IDE plugins.  
> Select the “CodenameOne Settings” from the plugin.(notice if you still see the old settings do an “update” from the Settings app menu and restart the app).
