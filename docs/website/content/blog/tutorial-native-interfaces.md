Our original [How Do I video](/how-do-i.html) covering native interfaces was pretty old by now and needed a serious refresh. I created a new one that goes into a lot of the details although can’t go as deep as the subject matter is pretty huge to begin with.

I see a lot of developers shy away from using native interfaces which is partially understandable. A big reason for picking Codename One is to avoid native. But this isn’t so bad or hard, if you get stuck implementing a native interface we are here to help you with that. Just ask us here, on stack overflow or in the discussion forum and we’ll help you with your issues.
