You might have noticed we’ve been a bit slow with updates over the past couple of weeks as we’re dealing with a bit of a backlog. With the kids on holiday from school it’s harder to keep up not to mention our travel plans for the summer. As such we’re officially in summer vacation until September.

During this time we won’t update the blog as that takes a bit too much. We will probably have Friday releases if warranted but this depends on commits. It will take us longer to evaluate some issues but we’ll still try to respond to everyone in a reasonable timeframe.  
Pro and enterprise support might be impacted as well due to personnel availability but should still provide fast response turnaround.
