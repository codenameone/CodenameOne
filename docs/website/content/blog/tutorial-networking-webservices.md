Networking in Codename One includes so many different options and some very complex capabilities. This tutorial doesn’t cover all the options but it tries to clarify the logic of why we have both `URL` and `ConnectionRequest`. It also explains the socket API types and which one makes sense in which situation.

We also provide a couple of simple examples of REST API calls and an overview of the different ways in which REST can be implemented.

The recent tutorials covered a lot of basics, we’ll get into more advanced stuff in the courses and eventually after we cover the basics in these tutorials.
