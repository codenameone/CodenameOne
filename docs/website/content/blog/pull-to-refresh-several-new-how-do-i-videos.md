Chen has been busy adding one of the more addictive features yet to Codename One: pull to refresh. If you are unfamiliar with the Twitter app, this feature essentially means that you pull the UI downwards from the top and an arrow appears indicating that the UI will refresh once you lift your finger. This is now baked into Codename One allowing you instantly add this sort of UI pattern! 

  
Cool and painfully addictive.  

  
I also added quite a few How Do I? tutorials over the past couple of months and 3 new ones today covering this, the hamburger sidemenu and override in platform. Check this out in the

section.
