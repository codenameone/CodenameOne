Codename One 5.0 (Social) will launch next week, to keep the code stable we are entering a week long code freeze. Please update your plugin installs frequently and report bugs immediately so we will have a stable release!

We’ve added a lot of new features to 5.0 but a few of the big things are pretty disruptive:

  * [OpenJDK Support with JDK 9, 10 & 11 support](/blog/uber-book-is-out-jdk-11.html)

  * [XIB Build Mode](/blog/no-more-ios-screenshots.html)

  * [New cloud servers](/blog/new-build-cloud.html)

Because all of these changes have many subtle implications we are relying on feedback from you on what’s working and what isn’t. If you run into any issue please [file the issue](http://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/) ASAP so we can move quickly and update the release if necessary.

During this week of code freeze we’ll try to update the documentation and prepare everything for the release.

### Upcoming Milestones

We will branch to the 5.0 branch in our repository and every change to the branch will be cherry picked individually.

Here are the coming releases after 5.0:

  * 6.0 (Chat) – Scheduled for February 19 2019

  * 7.0 (Video) – Scheduled for June 12 2019

You can track these milestones and the related tasks in our github project [here](https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/milestones).
