Tel Aviv, Israel – Mobile development platform Codename One is announcing the release of its 2.0 version on Wednesday, December 25th. In the 7 months since the May release of 1.1 Codename One has reached profitability, quadrupled its paying subscriber base and was downloaded by 500,000 developers. 

Codename One is a one of a kind solution that allows Java developers to build native applications that work on all mobile devices seamlessly. It combines an open source client architecture that integrates seamlessly with all major Java development environments: Eclipse, NetBeans and IntelliJ IDEA. To leverageits one of kind cloud build system. This unique architecture enables Java developers to build iPhone applications without owning a Mac or Windows Phone applications without a Windows 8 machine. 

Version 2.0 is a major leap forward with containing 300 new features and improvements to the 1.1 version such as: Support for IntelliJ IDEA, Google Play Ads, binary 3rd party libraries and much more.

The platform to date has been used to build over 5,000 native mobile applications and has received widespread, viral acclaim in technology and business media including InfoWorld, Slashdot, Hacker News, VentureBeat, Business Insider, The Next Web, Dr. Dobbs and Forbes.  
  
“The level of traction we are seeing is astounding, it is amazing that in less than 2 years we have amassed so many applications.” said co-founder and CEO Shai Almog.

Almog, along with co-founder Chen Fishbein, decided to launch the venture after noticing a growing inefficiency within mobile application development. By enabling developers to significantly cut time and costs in developing native applications for iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone and other devices, Almog and Fishbein hope to make mobile application development increasingly feasible.

The Java-based platform is open-source and utilizes lightweight technology, allowing it to produce unique native interfaces highly differentiated from competitive cross-platform mobile development toolkits, which typically use HTML5 or heavyweight technology.

The startup’s founders are recognized for engineering Sun Microsystems’s famous Lightweight User Interface Toolkit, a mobile platform used by leading mobile carriers and industry leaders to this date.

Codename One is available for download free of charge.
