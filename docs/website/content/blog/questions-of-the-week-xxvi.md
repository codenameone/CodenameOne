As you may recall [most of us are on vacation](/blog/merged-peer-october-vacations-india-trip.html) and the  
few of us who are not have to work even harder than usual to keep things chugging along. I’m in India for  
October (not on vacation) which slows down my work even further outside of my “home base”.

We’re releasing a much needed plugin update today with huge GUI builder changes, new round border support  
in the designer and many bug fixes in the settings etc.

On stack overflow things were as usual:

### TestRecorder How-To run test

You can run recorded tests via the tests ant target which maps directly to the tests IDE action in NetBeans

### Closing a socket

When you close a stream it implicitly closes the socket, when building this we thought that’s intuitive but I can  
see how this can be confusing

These should work fine for all google supported tablets

### Fingerprint scanner in codename one

Fingerprint scanning is still emerging, if we see enough demand for it we will add it just like any feature

### How to make date time picker components are editable in code name one?

These map to native code so they aren’t as customizable as other Codename One API’s.

### How to listen for cell selection on a table?

Overriding the create cell in the table allows the full power of Codename One components

### How to code an iPhone style popup menu in CN1?

[Read on stackoverflow…​](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39858529/how-to-code-an-iphone-style-popup-menu-in-cn1)

### Downloading file in Codename one

It’s important to keep `FileSystemStorage` & `Storage` separate

[Read on stackoverflow…​](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39857041/downloading-file-in-codename-one)

### How-to set app name and app icon

This should be pretty easy especially with the new Codename One Settings UI

[Read on stackoverflow…​](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39838237/codenameone-how-to-set-app-name-and-app-icon)

### How to generate JUnit XML reports in Codename One?

I didn’t even remember we had this and it’s code that I wrote…​ I don’t know if I’m too old or if I wrote too much code…​

[Read on stackoverflow…​](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39836969/how-to-generate-junit-xml-reports-in-codename-one)

### How to use resource file of GUI Designer

The transition to the new GUI builder will be painful because of the confusion aspect of two gui builders

[Read on stackoverflow…​](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39819480/codenameone-how-to-use-resource-file-of-gui-designer)

### Actionlistener not working

This was triggered by a new button created on top of the current button

[Read on stackoverflow…​](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39818572/codename-one-actionlistener-not-working)

### TextArea / Textfield datachange listener with growing

The whole single line text area is a source of a lot of confusion for developers, we need to find a way to make this  
more intuitive

[Read on stackoverflow…​](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39808804/codename-one-textarea-textfield-datachange-listener-with-growing)

### TextView Foreground Color

Maybe we should deprecate `getStyle()` just to get people to notice the incorrect usage of that method?

[Read on stackoverflow…​](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39806201/codenameone-textview-foreground-color)

The mask and image sizes must be identical, we throw this exception to prevent worse errors later on
