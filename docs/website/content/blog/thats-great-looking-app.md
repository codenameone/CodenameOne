I talk to a lot of mobile developers or those who are starting out in the field and by far the number one problem is getting a refined sublime app. There are too many difficulties and pitfalls along the way and the end result is often “sub par” in terms of the UI you want to achieve.  
We too bare responsibility for that. We focus too much on the technology and too little on making “gorgeous” easy. I want you to join me in changing that narrative…​

The narrative is very common: “you can’t have it all”. You will pay for cross platform by sub par UX or UI. You will “write once debug everywhere”.

Sometimes, that narrative is true. However, when you wield the tools effectively you can get better results than any other approach…​ You can design your app once and instantly adapt it to all OS’s with native feel. You can debug & optimize your app once and have a more stable/faster app across all OS’s.  
It’s not a magic bullet though. You need to learn how to wield these tools just like any tool within your toolbox and that’s where we failed you.

We provided [JavaDocs](/javadoc/) but they are too low level and assume you already know everything.

We have a better [developer guide](/files/developer-guide.pdf) but it doesn’t explain how to design a real app despite having 1000 pages of content…​

### Something Better

That’s why I started the [bootcamp](/blog/why-bootcamp.html), I needed to learn from the participants about the pain points and difficulties. Despite having a very wide skill set disparity between the participants I saw the advanced developers and beginners run into the exact same set of difficulties.

I’ve learned a lot. I learned how to build better course material, I understood where the main pitfalls lie in Codename One and I’ve condensed all of that together. You can see some of that work in my recent video tutorials, which are better looking and more concise.

I’ve applied this approach into the coming course material which is already completely different from everything I did in the past.

### Real Apps

This is probably the most important piece. Up until now none of our tutorials focused on creating real apps to the full extent and mostly stopped short. The closest we got was with the [chat app tutorial](/blog/building-a-chat-app-with-codename-one-part-1.html) and [property cross](/blog/property-cross-revisited.html) both of which are two of our most popular tutorials.

I think that this is the biggest missing piece in our educational stack and I think this is the piece that will help you transform your applications from good to great!

So here are the questions:

**What apps are you working on?**

**What sort of UI or functionality are you aiming at but can’t get right?**

I want this material to be “driven” by your real world needs, not by my guessing. So please help me out with some suggestions.

I’ve got something going and will write more about it during the week. We also have the code freeze for 3.7 which is just around the corner and we have some pretty huge surprises there!

> Social style app is indeed something I’d like to introduce. I already have some discussion on websockets in the material but the current app isn’t ideal for it. I might make better use of them in an upcoming app, in fact my biggest problem wasn’t with using websockets in Codename One (that was trivial) the problem was using them in Spring Boot, it worked but it was very hard to leverage their power properly.

> Maybe transitions are sometimes difficult to get right. Ie, you have to flush a previous transitions before the next one comes into place or you can have troubles, and this is not always obvious. If the user change tabs for instance, and there is a transition going on, the app might fail.
>
> Other transitions are not easy to figure out. I wanted a zoom effect, something similar to bubble transition, but that is for Dialog mostly. I ended up creating a custom layout to place the zoomed component (yes, I needed absolute positioning) and animating with animateLayout. I’m happy with the results.

If you notice something specific that you feel should be modernized please just file an issue with screenshots and what you’d expect. It helps us place priorities on what we need to do otherwise we just guess about what’s important.

>
> — What sort of UI or functionality are you aiming at but can’t get right?  
> My app has a very basic UI – there is no animation or transition effects etc. It is just basic text fields that are populated with values which I store and fire off in the request. You would think that such an app would have no UI challenges … but it does. For example when I open a screen that contains the BODY of a POST request (which is read from a properties file), the text field appears blank. However it is not blank because when I drag my mouse over the text it highlights. And then when I click off, I can see the text.

> Nick Koirala says:
>
> What apps are you working on?  
> I work on a range of apps, most of the time they have relatively ‘standard’ and simple UI and I use the Flat Blue theme or similar. I like how it looks clean and simple to start with and customers and usually happy with it but I don’t like how many UIIDs need to be edited to change colours etc., (some inheritance would make it more user friendly for other UI).  
> For more complex designs provided by graphic designers I’ve only used the old GUI Designer and found it takes a lot of patience but did get a handle on how it works and can usually get a good outcome.
>
> What sort of UI or functionality are you aiming at but can’t get right?  
> Recently I’ve had to make a web app which means taking a break from Codename One for one project. For this I used Vue and Vue Material and was impressed with how quick and easy it is to get a very polished material design UI using those components.
>
> Coming back to Codename One (and trying the new Gui Builder for the first time) I notice that not only is the GUI Builder ‘quirky’ it is also complex to get the same polish and the quirks (particularly around selecting components or adding them in the right place) make it time consuming to get things right so sometimes I just give up short of the outcome I’d like. For example for I use BorderLayout and BoxLayout Y more often than any other type of layout, but all new Forms and Containers in the GUI Builder default to FlowLayout, and the highlighted component in the tree isn’t always the one that is actually selected (GUI Builder bug) so it involves a lot of clicking and fiddling around just to get layouts set, moving a component in and out of a BorderLayout container changes the layout constraints of all the other elements. The upshot of this is that when on a time and budget the layouts have to be done right and then nice polish aspects sometimes get neglected.
>
> I realise that this complexity in the Codename One GUI system is due to the flexibility (Vue Material can ONLY do material design components – even down to enforcing colours from the Material Design specifications) – I’m sure Codename One can produce any type of UI given time and patience.
>
> Perhaps a module could be developed that allows for material design components that clearly match the standards and have them as optional – I know most of my clients on Android and iOS want clean and tidy modern looking applications but don’t have extensive design requirements beyond that, simple drop in material design components would make this a breeze in Codename One, and would produce apps for me at least that would be a step up from the current theme options without adding a lot of work to each project. Its very difficult to replicate material design appearance and interactivity using the current tools.

> I very much agree with everything you said. Keep your eye open for our 3.7 announcement next week… We have big news regarding the gui builder…
>
> I agree we need to refine the default look/themes and bring them to the modern age. A lot of the work we did such as the RoundBorder and gradient performance improvements were infrastructure work so we can go back to the themes and remove the usage of hardcoded images within.
>
> Material design components is one of the top features in my list. Some of the developers I talked to specifically mentioned the pull to refresh component which has an outdated look. Others mentioned the OnOffSwitch and there are components that are completely missing.
>
> You can help by filing issues, providing screenshots of how default apps look today or a component looks today and a screenshot of how you would expect it to look. There are so many tasks and issues we get thru every release that it’s really hard to keep an eye on the ball and these are probably the most important and relatively easy to address issues… But we need you to actually ask for that!

> In terms of the whole UI/theme thing, I think you really should make it more clear to new users that the “native theme” is NOT actually native components, but a CN1 generated “look a like”. (I know you can call native, but that’s a slightly different animal). Personally, I _like_ the fact that I can have a UI design that is invariant across platforms – I don’t really understand why people perceive that Google’s L&F of the month or Apple’s is the “one right way”, and people think that CN1 leads to a “lowest common denominator”, which it doesn’t because all the widgets are light weight anyway.

The goal of our subproject is to parse this XML into a relational database (done) and to build a client app to use both as dictionary and utility to maintain the database with.

> Hi,  
> This wasn’t possible in the past but is now possible thanks to peer component z-ordering. It’s mostly a matter of building a peer component that will encapsulate camera views. I’ve looked into it a bit and while it’s doable there is a lot of nuance. Since this isn’t something you can do in PhoneGap there is no plugin we can reference for ideas and it does take some work.
>
> I thought about doing something like this in one of the modules just teach how to build a cn1lib for camera. I looked at it and it’s got a lot of low level OS complexities so I have some concerns that this will become an iOS and Android internals tutorial but it might be worth hitting this if there is interest.

> Thanks, that’s very helpful!
>
> – Yes, we map the basic common use cases and move to the next task. If we’d map every potential use case for Google Maps we might not reach other tasks and might be wasting our time mapping functionality no one actually needs.
>
> We implemented the original maps based on a request from an enterprise customer, Features that came later are based on user demand. If people don’t ask for stuff it will never get done and the way to ask for stuff is file an RFE in the project.
>
> An even more effective way is pull request, you just implement the features you want and have them integrated into the library. One of the nice things about the maps library is that it’s relatively small and standalone. You could probably implement these features yourself in the code without knowing too much because the code is so small. If you run into issues doing it that’s exactly why we are here and we can help you with that. There were several pull requests to that library and that’s probably the best way to get a feature integrated. The whole value of a library like this is the extensibility and ability to implement stuff without our help. I know of a user who forked this lib and converted it to use a China based mapping service since Google Maps doesn’t work well there. Unfortunately he didn’t publish his work.
>
> I’ll be working on an Uber clone as part of these courses and if something is necessary for that common type of use case I’ll probably implement this.
>
> – When you go offline you can handle errors globally or locally. Our simulator includes an option to simulate slow connection and offline as well. If you have a specific example of a problem just post a question on stackoverflow and we’ll try to help you.
>
> – We have a performance section in the developer guide but yes I agree that the developer guide is structured more as a reference than a guide or cookbook. That’s something I hope to change with the courses which try to be more pragmatic.
>
> – Are you using millimeters for sizing fonts?
>
> We have a lot of legacy there so the UX is awful. Select one of the native fonts and select millimeter size.
>
> – I’m not sure I follow the issue with the “proportions”. Are you referring to multi image, background image behaviors, scale behavior or layout. There are some nuances and they are partially mixed with legacy. We’re trying to simplify that.
>
> – I don’t understand the point about Bluetooth LE – that cn1lib has some issues. I think it was a mistake leaving the code too close to the original Cordova implementation as it has some issues. It’s also problematic because it doesn’t work in the simulator.
>
> I think there are two potential solutions one is to implement the JavaSE version of the native interfaces so it works in the simulator and the second is on device debugging. We’re working on on-device-debugging but it’s hard to know when that will launch as it’s pretty damn big.  
> Implementing the JavaSE native interfaces for Bluetooth LE so you can debug in the simulator is something that community members can probably help with similarly to the work with google maps.
>
> I agree we could use more maturity but I think the biggest things we need to focus on are:
>
> – Good looking UI by default  
> – GUI builder
>
> – Instructional materials & resources  
> – Debugging and error handling tools
>
> The cn1libs are a perfect space for the community to fill in the gaps, if we try to do too much there we end up in constant maintenance mode instead of moving the product forward as a whole.

Guibuilder does have some issues with navigation but it is so much better. I would like to see more themes. Even a market place for themes would be nice. I would typically purchase my app themes online via themeforest. Maybe you could work with them to create a market for them or sell them directly via this site.
