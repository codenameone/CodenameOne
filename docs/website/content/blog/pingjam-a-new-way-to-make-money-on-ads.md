We have many interesting ways for you to make money using Codename One and  
[  
pingjam  
](http://get.pingjam.com/codenameone)  
is one of the most innovative ways we ran into.  
[  
Pingjam  
](http://get.pingjam.com/codenameone)  
ads are placed within the dialer window based on the number you are dialing to, e.g. you dial to purchase a pizza you might get an ad offering a discount for purchasing over the web! 

  
  
  
This means  
  
a great CTR rate since users receive ads that are very relevant just when they are about to make a purchase!  
  
  
**  
  
You get paid for the number of active installs

‘s innovation  
  
doesn’t stop there. Unlike other ad networks it doesn’t pay out per click but rather per install similarly to the  
[  
startapp  
](http://www.codenameone.com/startapp.html)  
model which allows you to rely on a monthly payment of a predictable sum without being concerned about ad visibility. Pingjam pays $5/month for every 1000 active app installs in the USA and Canada (or $1 elsewhere). Note that your revenue is based on how many active installs you have, and not whether your users see or click on any of the ads. You get paid regardless of whether your app was used during the month. In essence, Pingjam pays you for distributing their service.  
  
  
One of the nicest things about  
  
our current monetization methods is that they all can be used together and do not conflict with one another so you can have multiple concurrent revenue streams!

  
Notice that once the application is removed pingjam is uninstalled cleanly and does not leave a mark on the phone/dialer.  

  
  
[  
Pingjam  
](http://get.pingjam.com/codenameone)  
is currently only available on Android for obvious reasons, to set it up all you need to do is sign up in their website and then go to the right click settings section in the monetization dialog (NetBeans only at the moment) and set your advertiser key in that section (the update containing that feature will be released April 30th). 

According to Pingjam, the addition of the caller ID service does not impact install rates at all:  

* * *

> We have proven this by running extensive tests on hundreds of thousands of installs and dozens of apps. The results were conclusive – install rates are unchanged and uninstall rates aren’t affected.

> Its similar to startapp in that sense, they pay “rent” for the ad space and the app that “owns” that space is the first one where the user accepted the terms (probably first one installed).

> Another benefit is that this is a relatively young network so your chances of reaching a “virgin” device are very high.
