Answering common question is what a FAQ is usually for, but usually that’s just not enough. A common presentation tip is: “Show, don’t tell”.  
  
Which is why we launched the  
[  
“How Do I?”  
](http://www.codenameone.com/how-do-i.html)  
section in the Codename One website, this section contains short video tutorials demonstrating how to do small things in Codename One from creating your first Codename One application to monetizing and debugging it (upcoming).  
  
We hope to flesh out this section with more videos as time goes on, feel free to ask for future videos right here.
