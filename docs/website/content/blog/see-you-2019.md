Happy holidays, Merry Christmas, happy new year to all. All of us here at Codename One hope you have a lovely vacation if you are taking one. Since half of our readership is from countries that celebrate these holidays it seems like a good time to take a short blogging vacation as well.

During this time we won’t blog and won’t make releases unless there are crucial issues. We’re still here for support but some things will be pushed into January.
