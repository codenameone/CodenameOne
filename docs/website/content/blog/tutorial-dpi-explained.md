I’ve been working on improved learning materials for Codename One. One of the problems with videos is that I can sometimes unintentionally drag an idea that can be explained with a single image. DPI is one of those ideas, I’m assuming most of you already understand it but even if you do, I think this graphic helps put things in perspective.

> The target audience for this graphic are programmers who have no experience in mobile. I just want to help visualize the density issue, not the solutions which would require a different graphic.
