Happy holidays, Merry Christmas, happy new year to all. All of us here at Codename One hope you have  
a lovely vacation if you are taking one. Since half of our readership is from countries that celebrate these  
holidays it seems like a good time to take a short blogging vacation as well.

We’re still working here and will make releases/offer support as usual but we’ll update you on the changes we  
had in our 2017 posts. We’ll be back to blogging on January 2nd.
