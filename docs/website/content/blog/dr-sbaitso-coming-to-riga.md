I’ll be speaking at  
[  
Riga Dev Day  
](http://www.rigadevday.lv)  
next week and I’ve been working on a demo for the conference. Back in my teen years I bought the SoundBlaster 1.0 which was one of the first affordable soundcards for the PC. One of the killer demos that shipped with it was a silly command line AI psychoanalyst by the name of  
[  
Dr. Sbaitso  
](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Sbaitso)  
that would try to dish out advice in all caps… 

It was actually surprisingly cool and gave a wide set of answers that were often pretty clever. As a salute to the wonderful developer who built that we created a simple chat demo that is more like the iMessage UI than like Dr. Sbaitso but it does use its signature opening tagline. 

The demo uses the new Toolbar API and some other cool capabilities such as camera capture, bubble chat, instant search etc. We even added a native interface so it will speak just like the original doctor!

We hope to make some videos that cover the new demo and how it works.
