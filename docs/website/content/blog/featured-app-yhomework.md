We’re all pretty jaded when it comes to software but when I first saw yHomework I was completely floored by it!

Where was this tool when I was in junior high?

If you haven’t seen [yHomework](http://www.yhomework.com/) in action I suggest you give it a try right now on your  
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MathUnderground.MathSolver) or  
[iOS device](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yhomework/id604715759).

In a nutshell the app accepts several types of math equations starting with the basic algebra e.g `3(x+5)=6` and then  
shows you the process of solving it as if a human teacher solved it for you. Including text explanation of every step  
that you can just read thru and understand!

This is ideal for students picking up the higher level math subjects who might struggle with an exercise, why does  
the answer in the book differ from my result?

### In Codename One

[yHomework](http://www.yhomework.com/) was one of the first major Codename One apps ever written, some of  
our features were explicitly built to help this app. Originally the author wrote an entire implementation in JavaScript  
and scrapped the whole thing our of concern for IP issues & a personal preference for Java.

__ |  Despite obfuscation JavaScript apps (e.g. PhoneGap/Cordova) can be unzipped and resold which is a  
common practice in some markets   
---|---  
  
The app makes use of many Codename One features including in-app-purchase, cn1libs for the ads, push notification etc.

In fact the app was so successful that it brought down our old push notification servers back in the day.

#### Portability

yHomework benefited greatly from it’s portability as a few years ago a competing iOS app went on a media blitz.  
yHomework saw it’s marketshare rise both on iOS and Android thanks to that competitors campaign. The rise  
was especially pronounced on Android (where the competitor wasn’t present) but also carried into iOS thanks  
to the social sharing effect.

With installs in the millions and great reviews yHomework shows that cross platform can be a fan favorite  
where the complaints users have are more around the fact that the app isn’t completely free than anything else…​

If I had to pick a favorite Codename One app I would pick yHomework. It shows that content and functionality  
is still king & the most important thing an app can deliver.

> The UI was designed before flat design took over, the general design was around the idea of familiarity to 7th-10th grade kids (notebook, calculator motif). My one complaint about the UI is it’s performance which I think could be improved significantly.  
> Since this app is so old by now it was developed before there were “best practices” for Codename One and a lot of things could probably be accomplished in a more efficient way.
