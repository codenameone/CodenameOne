This material is out of date by now. We recommend checking out the [Codename One Academy](/blog/launching-codename-one-academy.htmls). 

We just released a new online course on Udemy called  
“[Learn Mobile Programming By Example With Codename One](https://www.udemy.com/learn-mobile-programming-by-example-with-codename-one/)“.  
Before a single day went by we already have over 600 students enrolled which is pretty cool. This course is based on the videos we made for the  
[Dr. Sbaitso](http://www.codenameone.com/blog/dr-sbaitso) demo and the  
[PropertyCross demo](http://www.codenameone.com/blog/propertycross-demo) with some additional  
videos thrown in to tie everything together and introduce Codename One. 

We’d appreciate if you would help us spread the word about this and inform people about  
[this course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-mobile-programming-by-example-with-codename-one/).  
FYI in case you are new here and missed it, we also have another free course on Udemy covering the  
[photo share app](http://udemy.com/build-mobile-ios-apps-in-java-using-codename-one/).  
That course is also available on [youtube](http://codenameone.com/blog/build-mobile-ios-apps-in-java-using-codename-one-on-youtube),  
we also have the [Codename One 101](http://udemy.com/codenameone101/) course which is free for pro subscribers.
