We are about to release a brand new product:  
[  
Maker  
](/maker.html)  
. Codename One Maker is an App that allows non-developers to build native applications directly from their mobile phone or tablet by using the Codename One backend.  
  
The tool is relatively simple and produces “cookie cutter” applications, however we think that you would be able to build amazing plugins to make the tool truly powerful  
  
. We intend to introduce a plugin architecture based on our Codename One libraries that will allow you to build extensions to Maker using our standard Java API and native code. 

  
For now Maker contains an option to get the Codename One source code upon build completion which will allow novices to prototype the applications they want then give a developer the source code in order to get the professional features into place. Let us know what you think in the comments below.
