Shortly after introducing  
[  
Mirah support for Codename One  
](http://www.codenameone.com/blog/mirah-for-codename-one)  
, Steve is back with something that is arguably even more impressive. Over the weekend Steve released a tool called  
[  
CN1ML  
](http://sjhannah.com/blog/?p=345)  
which is an HTML subset markup language that allows you to effectively build Codename One UI’s with HTML. This isn’t another embedded webbrowser or HTMLComponent, this is a tool that statically translates HTML syntax into Codename One components. The benefit here is that you can keep all the advantages of using Codename One widgets (portability, performance, customizability etc.) with the HTML like syntax.  
  
  
  
  
When we were at Sun, our manager Yoav Barel was heavily on our case for building exactly that and we effectively convinced him that its not feasible to do this since its too much work. I guess we should have known about Steve back then!  
  
  
I think this is a very interesting idea and direction, one of the things I’d really like to see here is proper box model spanning behavior (float etc.) which is very tricky to do in Codename One today. Amazingly this is also very tricky to do natively in iOS/Android so we are all on the same boat…

## Java One  
  

We are here in the lovely city of San Francisco and having a blast, we have a pretty amazing announcement to make but until the contract is signed we’ll keep that low key.  
  
  
  
I’ll do a more detailed report on the complete trip, the parties and the booth but for now I’ll leave you with a few pictures I grabbed and some tags.
