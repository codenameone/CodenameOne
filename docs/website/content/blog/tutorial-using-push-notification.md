Push gets a lot of support queries, it’s a hard subject to wrap your head around especially with all of the conflicting and shifting landscape around it. To make matters worse every OS conceptualizes it very differently. I go into some of the really advanced stuff such as fallback behavior in the [advanced course](https://codenameone.teachable.com/p/build-real-world-full-stack-mobile-apps-in-java) but basic stuff is still a crucial first step.

So I adapted some of the material from there and re-did the push [How Do I? video](/how-do-i---use-push-notification-send-server-push-messages.html) to use the newer API’s and settings. Check out that page for the full transcript of the video.

Notice that push is a pretty big subject and I couldn’t cover everything in a 15 minute video so I didn’t discuss other platforms such as Windows and JavaScript (both of which are supported). I didn’t discuss parsing the JSON results from our servers and handling them even though there is a lot of nuance there. It’s just too much to discuss and JSON parsing in JavaSE isn’t something I’d like to discuss right now.
