We had a lot of posts covering images, multi-image and density. It’s one of the more challenging concepts to explain to developers coming from a desktop development background. Density is a simple concept to explain but the implications of it are sometimes counter-intuitive e.g. which device has higher density: Your phone or your 4k TV?

The answer is your phone and I explain why in the video.

I also discuss the need to adapt UI’s for tablets to make better use of the available space although I don’t go deep into that subject. It might be worth covering that in a separate video, I discuss this in the [academy](http://codenameone.teachable.com/) though…​
