Codename One 4.0 (Taxi) will launch next week, to keep the code stable we are entering a week long code freeze. Please update your plugin installs frequently and report bugs immediately so we will have a stable release!

We’ve added a lot of new features to 4.0 but the big things are pretty disruptive:

  * Xcode 9.2 switch

  * Update Framework

Because both of these changes have many subtle implications we are relying on feedback from you on what’s working and what isn’t. If you run into any issue please [file the issue](http://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/) ASAP so we can move quickly and update the release if necessary.

During this week of code freeze we’ll try to update the documentation and prepare everything for the release.

### Upcoming Milestones

This is our first release in the new numbering scheme and our first code named release.

We will branch to the 4.0 branch in our repository and every change to the branch will be cherry picked individually.

Here are the coming releases after 4.0 (Taxi):

  * 5.0 (Social) – Scheduled for July 17th 2018

  * 6.0 (Name Pending) – Scheduled for November 14 2018

You can track these milestones and the related tasks in our github project [here](https://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/milestones).
