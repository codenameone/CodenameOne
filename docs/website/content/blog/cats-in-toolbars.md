Chen spent some time working on some Toolbar effects such as the rich title areas made popular by social network apps such as G+ & Twitter. The new Flickr demo in SVN now shows a really cool ability to fold the title bar as we scroll down and expand it when we scroll up. It also shows an image based title area that can fade out of view during scrolling. Check out the video below to get a taste of the possibilities. 

We hope to make an update to the plugin this week or the next, it will include the new Toolbar functionality and other fixes.

On the new VM front we closed multiple open bugs in the new VM and are considering it a solid beta. We are starting to look into new features that we can enable thanks to its architecture.
