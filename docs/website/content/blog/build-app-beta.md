One of the big “behind the scenes” motivations for our big [build cloud migration](https://www.codenameone.com/blog/new-build-cloud.html) was new server API’s. We now have a completely new backend and this made it easier to build a completely new Codename One App christened as “Codename One Build”.

This app is currently in public beta on Android which you can opt-into [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.codename1.build.app). Once we feel good with the Android version we’ll push out versions for iOS and maybe UWP if there’s demand for that.

To keep things simple we are currently focusing on the bare minimum so we can build on top of that. Furthermore, it’s at version 0.13 so it’s far from production grade. But it works really well and should be instantly useful for all of us. It includes several interesting features:

  * Push notifications on builds

  * Essentially eliminates the need of using the website for build tracking

  * Ability to subscribe using In-App-Purchase – this is highly experimental so if you run into a problem let us know!

__ |  We made the app beta to get it out as soon as possible but for all intents and purposes this is Alpha level software

We have big plans for this app and have some pretty interesting ideas for it as we move forward. Right now we want to focus on the core functionality so it runs as smoothly as possible. As it matures we might use this app as the basis for a new web UI as well.

We plan to push frequent updates to this app and refine it as we go. So we need your help with issues which you can file in the [usual place](http://github.com/codenameone/CodenameOne/issues/).
