The jat app is very similar to whatsapp in some regards but is more oriented towards group communication  
than SMS replacement. Over the past couple of weeks we picked it up as a great communication tool in our team.  
It uses push notifications to notify and activates accounts via SMS. This makes it very convenient for someone  
like myself who moves between devices constantly.

Chat is a very common use case for developers in the Codename One community which is why I chose this app  
as one of our first highlighted apps. I highly recommend playing with the app to see some of the things you  
can do in Codename One.

You can see the app [featured page here](/featured-jat.html). You can check out the  
[ios version here](https://itunes.apple.com/il/app/jat-communication/id1094392187) and the  
[android version here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jat.app).
