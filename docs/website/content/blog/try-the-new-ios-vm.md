We just updated the build servers with the latest version of the Codename One iOS VM. This is still a work in progress and there is no guarantee your application will work. However, you can start playing with this right now and you might enjoy some of the benefits including proper stack traces, faster builds, smaller code size & faster performance.  
  
  
  
  
To try this just define the build argument ios.newVM=true  
  
  
  
  
At some point we will flip this to be the default but for now this will still be off.  
  
  
  
  
Notice that some behaviors such as native interfaces will only be enabled in a few days and other features defined by build arguments might not yet work. However, we are looking for some bugs and crash reports for this functionality so if you run into an issue here feel free to let us know here or on the discussion forum.
