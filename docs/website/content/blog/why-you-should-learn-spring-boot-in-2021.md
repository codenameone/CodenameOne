Spring Boot is an open source Java framework used to create micro services. Learn why you should learn Spring Boot in 2021?

### What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a lightweight framework for Java developers to develop stand-alone and production-grade spring applications that “just run”.

Spring Boot shortens the Spring framework code length and provides you with the easiest way to develop an application with minimum configurations.

You can call it a framework of framework as it supports many frameworks such as Hibernate, EJB (Enterprise Java Bean) etc.

### Why Spring Boot?

Spring Boot removes a lot of hassle and boilerplate from Java coding. It makes Java code fluid and concise without trading scalability.

Spring Boot offers many advantages to developers such as:

- – Easy to understand and develop spring applications.
- – Increases productivity: Flexible configuration of Java Beans, XML, and Database Transactions.
- – Reduces the development time: Everything is auto configured.

### Learn Spring Boot

We have partnered with [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) to bring Java developers a beginner friendly Udemy course that aims to help you quickly build and deploy production-ready microservices within the Java and JVM ecosystem using Spring Boot 2.

> I have known for the first time and learned Spring Boot following Shai’s courses in the Codename One Academy and deepening on my own: in fact, at the beginning it was an uphill path rather difficult, but now I can say that Codename One + Spring Boot are my daily bread to make “real” applications. Perhaps my greatest demonstration of how Codename One + Spring Boot is a winning combination is when I made a desktop application for Windows in just one day, an application still used today, which is a small backend for a website made by me (obviously I had a lot of code ready because I used it in other projects, otherwise it would not have been possible). It needs a lot of study and patience to use Codename One + Spring Boot.
