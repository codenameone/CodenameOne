Our email api only supported a single attachment until now. We just added an api that allows for multiple attachments which we will add in the next update. Notice that multiple attachments will only work on iOS/Android at the moment. 

  
  
Also in this update you would find a fix for the Twitter service (see the TwitterRESTService class) and some other capabilities such as support for network performance issues.

  
  
The simulator now allows you to simulate a case of no network connectivity and slow connectivity. This simulation isn’t accurate but it should help in gauging the feel for such cases and debugging complex scenarios. To see this in action just select the Network section in the simulator menu and select the mode for the simulator to run in.
