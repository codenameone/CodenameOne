At JavaOne/Oracle Open World the wristband allows you to attend the ”  
[  
appreciation event  
](https://www.oracle.com/openworld/bands/index.html)  
” featuring Aerosmith, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis and Spacehog. Unfortunately Oracle employees don’t get the wristband that allows everyone to attend that event!  
  
  
  
  
  
So I’m personally giving away my wristband and we might get some additional wristband donations to give away to Oracle employees so if you are an Oracle employee just retweet  
[  
our tweet representing this article  
](https://twitter.com/Codename_One/status/514638244076466177)  
and/or share this via Facebook (publicly) then drop by our booth to log your name/email.  
  
  
  
  
We will hold the raffle on Wednesday at 3pm in our booth  
  
  
be sure to be there in order to claim the wristband or we will have to give it to someone else.
