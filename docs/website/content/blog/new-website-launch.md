**Important update below**. After a very long journey we will launch the new Codename One website on October 2nd. Since this will only deal with the website itself most things should still work as they did before. Thanks to the [cloud dashboard](https://cloud.codenameone.com/buildapp/index.html) the migration shouldn’t disrupt any users and should be 99% superficial.

__ |  The launch will be delayed tentatively to October 9th but possibly even later   
---|---  
  
One thing that might be impacted are website comments which we will need to migrate to a new system. Initially the new website will launch without comments which we will need to re-integrate.

There might also be some disruption to discussion forum posts as we plan to migrate the discussion forum to a new medium.

Notice that we will try to keep links as close as possible to the previous links but that might be challenging so some links (specifically to the developer guide) will redirect to a new location. There might be a period of DNS reshuffling as the new website will occupy a different server.

__ |  That’s one of the motivations for conducting this migration on a Friday   
---|---  
  
As part of this migration login on the website will no longer be available/required. Since the dashboard is no longer in this site this shouldn’t be an issue. Some pages will still be unavailable and will be added as we move forward.
