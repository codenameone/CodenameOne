A Codename One community member  
[  
Antonio Mannucci offered  
](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/codenameone-discussions/wumShzMwUmw/1JAFcEanABAJ)  
to release a gaming API that he created a while back. It took him some time but he finally delivered on his promise by  
[  
releasing a cn1lib for simple 2D games in Codename One  
](https://code.google.com/p/core2d-cn1lib/)  
and a demo game to go with it. 

The project is still pretty rough in the sense that there is no real documentation or getting started guide. However, there isn’t much that needs saying… Just checkout the code and build the library then run the example demo. The demo has some issues that I’m unclear about but it looks promising.

The basic concepts of Sprites, tiles, touch keypad, music & sound effects all seem to be in place. I’m not sure where this is going since gaming isn’t in our core focus, but if you are interested in building a game using Codename One then looking/contributing to this project might be interesting.
