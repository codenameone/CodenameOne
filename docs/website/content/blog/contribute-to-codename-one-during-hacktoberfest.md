### Why Contribute to Codename One?

## History

Codename One is a revolutionary mobile development solution started by ex-Sun Microsystems developers based on work that started within Sun. Codename One delivers the Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA) promise of Java for mobile devices by intelligently cross compiling to native code.

## Established & Mature

Codename One version 1.0 was released in 2012. It was the first solution to build native iPhone apps in Java and is still the most mature, performant and stable cross-platform mobile toolkit on the market.

It is now being used by many well-known organizations including banks, government agencies and startups.

## Free & Open Source

The core of Codename One is free and open source. GPL + CE licensed so it is free to use with commercial projects.

## Community

Codename One has a consolidated and active community of developers and enthusiasts.

If you are a true believer in Java and the power of cross-platform, you can help make Codename One even better! 🙌
