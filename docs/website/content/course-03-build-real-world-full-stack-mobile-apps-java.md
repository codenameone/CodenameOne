This is the final course released as part of our 2017-2019 courses for Codename One mobile development. Wehope you find it useful. Even though some material is out of date, the vast majority is still very relevant and applicable.

We worked with many mobile developers over the years and one common thread is the process of solving the same problems all over again. Everyone is building an Uber clone, a social media app, a restaurant ordering app or some other common template.

Even if you aren't it's very likely you are building a variation of the same idea e.g. one of my friends has a startups that bills itself as "air b&b for eating at peoples homes"... This is common even in corporate applications where we redo the same ideas again & again.

This course tries to build the common templates and it's constantly evolving to add more applications!

It offers a set of full featured app building tutorials from start to finish without skimming on details...

I cover the full stack which is rare in the Java world. We go into the server side, the client side, deployment to the stores, server provisioning in the cloud, database creation, UI design, adapting the design, working with photoshop, coding, security and every other aspect you can think of in this course.
