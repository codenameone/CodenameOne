### FAQs

What Is Codename One? How does it work?

Codename One is an open-source cross-platform WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) mobile app development framework that allows Java & Kotlin developers to build truly native multi-platform apps with 100% code reuse.

Apps are compiled down to native code for maximum performance and a smooth user experience.

To understand how Codename One works, check the [introduction](https://www.codenameone.com/introduction.html) or this [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10639766/how-does-codename-one-work/10646336#10646336).

Is Codename One free? Is it open source?

Yes. Codename One is open-source and free for use commercially and non-commercially with no royalties or restrictions.

You can use the optional build service which is available in a free quota. This service makes building apps simpler and also lets developers on Windows/Linux build native iOS apps. Notice that the JavaScript port is closed source.

What are the limits of the free version?

Notice that these only apply to the build cloud which is 100% optional.

You are limited to 100 build credits per month. 1 build credit equals 1 build, except for iOS where 8 credits are spent per 1 build to offset the higher costs of Mac servers.

Other than that, there is a JAR size limit of 1mb. Notice that this is a very high limit as it applies only to your bytcode and not to the overhead of the Codename One class libraries!

You are **allowed** to use your generated apps commercially and have no restrictions on them. You don’t get some of the benefits that come with the various paid grades.

Can I cancel or change plan anytime?

Yes, Codename One provides 100% no questions asked 30 day money back guarantee for all purchases.

What payment methods do you accept?

You can pay using a credit card, debit card or PayPal. Your payments are processed securely by Paddle. You will be charged right away when you subscribe to a paid plan and then every month or year, depending on your selected billing interval.

Paddle uses local currency (optional), adds VAT where applicable and produces invoices.

Annual pro or higher subscriptions can be paid via SWIFT bank transfers and invoicing. To get a price proposal/pro-forma invoice use the chat button on the bottom right of the screen.

What are build size restrictions?

Build size restrictions relate to the size of the user JAR before compilation not the final app on which there is no such restriction.

They don’t apply to Maven local builds, only to server quotas.

Can I share my account?

The prices above are per developer seat and include multiple platforms with no royalties or hidden fees.

Please notice that accounts can’t be shared and must be uniform within the organization. A company can’t have one developer at enterprise grade and another one at pro grade or free.

Can I build more than one app?

There are no limits on the number of apps or number of users! For paid plans, our pricing is per developer seat.

Will my app still work if I cancel my subscription?

Yes. The cloud is only used for build services. Once the app is built, it is a native local app. Notice that push notifications require server activity and will no longer function if you cancel the subscription.

Is my source code sent to the cloud?

**No!** We only send compiled bytecode to the cloud and process that bytecode. We don’t touch your source code.

Notice you can always build offline using Maven if you’re truly concerned about this.

There is a special case with native code which must be sent in source code form since it can’t be compiled on the client e.g. Objective-C code can only be compiled on a Mac with XCode.

All communications with our servers are done securely over SSL.

How many licenses do I need?

One per developer on your team that is working with Codename One. Notice that all licenses within the organization must be of the same subscription level and every developer needs a license.

Can I purchase a basic license for one developer in my team and an enterprise license for another?

No. All licenses within the organization must be of the same subscription level and every developer needs a license.

We find that additional developers start routing support requests through the paid account making the complexity of supporting the enterprise/pro account within the organization much higher.

If we end development with Codename One but still have an app in the store do we still need to pay?

Only if you use push/cloud services/crash protection or other cloud features. If you don’t use the runtime cloud services, the application will work without the cloud regardless of your subscription status.

Notice that the developer documentation highlights such services as cloud services and they are always limited to pro subscriptions or higher.

Do you offer academic licenses?

The base version of Codename One was designed to be sufficient for the needs of academic/research work so there is no need for academic specific licenses.

What is the license of the Codename One Source Code? Can I use the source code commercially?

The Codename One source code is licensed under the GPL with Classpath Exception, the classpath exception clause allows you to package binaries generated by the code into your application. You don’t need to open source your own code as a result, the only major requirement is that you contribute your changes to Codename One back or “make them available”.

Can I download the sources generated by the server?

Paid subscribers can download the sources generated by the server. However, sources are only generated for Android/iOS & Windows. Notice that not all ports offer sources that are truly useful.
