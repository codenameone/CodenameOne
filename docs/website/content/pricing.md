## FAQs

### What is Codename One? How does it work?
Codename One is an open-source cross-platform WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) mobile app development framework that lets Java and Kotlin developers build truly native multi-platform apps with high code reuse.

Apps are compiled down to native code for strong performance and smooth UX.

### Is Codename One free? Is it open source?
Yes. Codename One is open source and can be used commercially and non-commercially with no royalties or restrictions.

The optional cloud build service includes a free quota and lets developers on Windows/Linux build native iOS apps.

### What are the limits of the free version?
These limits apply to cloud builds only.

- 100 build credits per month.
- 1 build credit per build (iOS uses 8 credits due to Mac build costs).
- 8.5 MB user JAR size limit.

You can still use generated apps commercially. Paid plans mainly add higher quotas and advanced cloud features.

### Can I cancel or change plan anytime?
Yes. Codename One includes a 30-day money back guarantee for paid purchases.

### What payment methods do you accept?
Credit card and debit card through the Codename One secure signup flow.

For annual Pro/Enterprise subscriptions, SWIFT transfer and invoicing are available. Use the site chat to request a pro-forma invoice.

### Are there limits on number of apps?
No. Pricing is per developer seat, not per app.

### Will my app still work if I cancel subscription?
Yes. Built apps continue to work.

Cloud runtime services (e.g., push) require an active subscription.

### Is source code sent to the cloud?
No source code is sent for normal builds. Cloud builds process compiled bytecode.

Native platform sources may be uploaded when required for native compilation.
