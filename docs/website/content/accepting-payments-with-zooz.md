To integrate with Zooz you need to register with them here and create a new application in their console. Make sure to create separate applications for iOS and Android since the keys can't be reused between the platforms. We will try to add HTML5 support for Blackberry in a future update.

Once you did that the Codename One Payment API will seamlessly work with Zooz which is defined as a Manual payment provider and allows you to pay a fixed amount in a given currency.
