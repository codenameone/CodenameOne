This app demonstrates the use of The Google Maps library to embed a native map into a Codename One app. The app itself is basic. It contains buttons to add markers and paths to the map, as well as reposition the camera. One subtle feature that this app demonstrates, is the ability to render Codename One UI components over top of a native component.

Notice that the JavaScript HTML5 demo is not what we have on the device where applications are translated to native code!  
Since Apple doesn’t allow demos on itunes and doesn’t allow installing apps without itunes we can’t distribute the native app demos, you would need to build from source with an itunes demo account.
