#### Uber Clone

The Uber Clone application is available as part of the online course [Build Real World Full Stack Mobile Apps in Java](https://codenameone.teachable.com/p/build-real-world-full-stack-mobile-apps-in-java). The course includes almost 5 hours of videos explaining the project and its architecture coupled with the full source code of the client and sever code.

The application makes use of Codename One’s builtin native maps and includes most of the big ticket items required for building a taxi hailing application.

Due to the nature of the application we can’t redistribute it in precompiled demo form.
