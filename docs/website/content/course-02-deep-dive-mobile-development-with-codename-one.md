This is the second part of my online courses from 2017 that are now available for free. In this course we go beyond the developer guide and the online docs to explain how to work with crucial Codename One tools required for building real world apps. We explain everything from device portability to native interfaces (access to native device features) and much more!

As part of this course we cover the process of building a simple restaurant ordering system and we cover several complex Codename One API's.

The original version of the course included a section created by Chidiebere Okwudire the creator of parse4cn1 which is removed here. I chose to omit it since the status of the Parse project is unclear and I'm not sure about IP ownership for that section.
