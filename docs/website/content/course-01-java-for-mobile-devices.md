Following is the full text and videos of an online course hosted historically on teachable.

The full course includes videos, slides and transcripts comprising roughly 25 hours of material. It's somewhat out of date by the "latest and greatest" in Codename One, e.g. it predated Maven support and was created before we decided to focus on CSS. However, most of the concepts still apply and would probably work out of the box.

The first course covers all the basics of mobile development, how to build an app, etc. The followups cover the more advanced materials culminating in full scale app development of clones of popular apps such as Facebook, Uber, Whatsapp, etc. These clones also cover the server component briefly so they include portions covering Spring Boot and other full stack concepts.
