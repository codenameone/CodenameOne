# Corporate Server

On-site installation of the Codename One cloud for large corporate/government entities.

1. [Home](/)
2. Corporate Server

**Important:** After much deliberation with corporate customers we are discontinuing the corporate server in favor of a more dynamic option for offline build. If you require offline builds please use the [contact us](/contact-us.html) form to contact sales and we will follow up with details on our upcoming offering.  
We intend to launch a beta preview of this new offering in Q4 2016 for early adopters.

A corporate sever allows companies to install a private Codename One build cloud within their company, this means that Codename One builds will be performed on the local network and not in the cloud. The corporate server is completely isolated and never contacts Codename One, the same is true for applications created by the corporate server which now rely on it to perform push and other tasks. The Codename One build server requires a complex installation involving a minimum of 4 machines that can't be fully virtualized, it is a task for a trained system administrator. To get a sense of the complexity involved see the corporate server install guide here:

[Download Install GuidePDF instructions for installing the corporate server](/files/corporate_server_install_guide.pdf)

Since the server is hosted within the organization Codename One places no limitations on the number of developers using the server, however Codename One developer support must be purchased separately since there is no way for Codename One to properly price support incidents for such cases.

## Enterprise vs. Corporate Server

The two products are very different from one another. Enterprise subscription still uses the Codename One build cloud and is a managed SaaS solution whereas the corporate server is a traditional offline software installation that uses an internal cloud.

If you have the ability, we recommend that you go with the enterprise license which is both cheaper, more flexible and easier to work with by a very large margin. However, if you are in a highly regulated/restricted field that doesn't allow for such a product you need to be aware of the differences between enterprise and corporate servers. Some features were removed from the corporate server to make the offline install simpler. See the table below:

|   | Enterprise | Corporate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On-Site Private Cloud |  |  |
| Cloud Storage |  |  |
| Versioning |  |  |
| Live Preview |  |  |
