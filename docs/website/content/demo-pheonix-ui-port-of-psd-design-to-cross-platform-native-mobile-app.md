This demo ports a set of PSD designs to a fully functional cross platform Codename One app, it also takes those designs for a high resolution Android device and makes them useable in any resolution device.  
Since this isn’t a “real application” with functionality it can’t be distributed thru the stores so we can’t provide an iOS version or even upload it to Google Play. We provide the ability to download the APK for Android and full source code. Notice that the images are all actual device screenshots from an Android One Plus One device.

Notice that the JavaScript HTML5 demo is not what we have on the device where applications are translated to native code!
