### New Project Wizard

Use the “Codename One Application” project type in  
the new project wizard. Select from existing app  
templates to give you a jump start on your beautiful  
native app. Or select a bare-bones starting point with a  
simple “Hello World” message.

### Test In the Simulator

Press “Run” to launch your app in the Codename One simulator. Select from a comprehensive list of skins to see how your app will look on the actual device.

### Build Your App

Press “Send iOS Appstore Build” to send your app to our cloud build servers, where they will compile it down to native code using the official platform tool-chains, and give you back an appstore-ready app. The “Codename One” menu includes build targets for all major mobile platforms, and even a few that aren’t mobile.
