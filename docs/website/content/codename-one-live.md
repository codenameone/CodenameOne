The Codename One LIVE! mobile application allows developers to monitor their Codename One Build Server & connect to the Codename One Designer for live editing of user interface elements on the device!

When a build is completed on the Codename One Build Server developers can simply launch Codename One LIVE! and click on the application entry to instantly install the application over the air! Furthermore, when developing user interfaces using the Codename One Designer tool, the Codename One LIVE! application allows developers/designers to preview the UI being built on the desktop instantly. Without the process of sending a build. This allows developers and designers to work closely together and get instant feedback on device "feel" for their user interfaces.

You can install Codename One LIVE! by logging into the build server and selecting the LIVE! tab within it.
