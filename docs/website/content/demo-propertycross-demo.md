PropertyCross demonstrates a simple handcoded UI that connects to a JSON webservice. It shows local caching of images using URLImage and general caching of network operations. It allows you to browse thru content with infinite scrolling containers and mark favorites.

Notice that the JavaScript HTML5 demo is not what we have on the device where applications are translated to native code!  
Since Apple doesn’t allow demos on itunes and doesn’t allow installing apps without itunes we can’t distribute the native app demos, you would need to build from source with an itunes demo account.
