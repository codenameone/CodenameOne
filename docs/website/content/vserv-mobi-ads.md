The Vserv.mobi ad network provides a unique proposition where ads are displayed in full screen before during and sometimes after application execution. The biggest feature within vserv is its ability to seamlessly integrate with an existing application and provide value to the developers without changing a single line of application code.

The CodenameOne plugin only requires your Vserv ZoneId to integrate the SDK and enable Premium Ads on your App. To test your integration you can set the ZoneID to 8063 to enable test Ads.

To get started, register with [Vserv.mobi here](http://vserv.mobi/dev).
