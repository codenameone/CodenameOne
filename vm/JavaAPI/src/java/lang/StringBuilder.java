/**
 * A string builder implements a mutable sequence of characters. A string builder is like a String, but can be modified. At any point in time it contains some particular sequence of characters, but the length and content of the sequence can be changed through certain method calls.
 * String builders are not threadsafe. 
 * String builders are used by the compiler to implement the binary string concatenation operator + (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/57750844">this discussion</a> for more info).
 * The principal operations on a StringBuilder are the append and insert methods, which are overloaded so as to accept data of any type. Each effectively converts a given datum to a string and then appends or inserts the characters of that string to the string builder. The append method always adds these characters at the end of the builder; the insert method adds the characters at a specified point.
 * For example, if z refers to a string builder object whose current contents are "start", then the method call z.append("le") would cause the string builder to contain "startle", whereas z.insert(4, "le") would alter the string builder to contain "starlet".
 * In general, if sb refers to an instance of a StringBuilder, then sb.append(x) has the same effect as sb.insert(sb.length(),x).
 * Every string builder has a capacity. As long as the length of the character sequence contained in the string builder does not exceed the capacity, it is not necessary to allocate a new internal builder array. If the internal builder overflows, it is automatically made larger.
 * Since: JDK1.0, CLDC 1.0 See Also:ByteArrayOutputStream, String

This strategy is effective for reducing the amount of memory allocated by a string concatenation operation when it is implemented using a string builder.
